        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 54pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">First, you need to know the location of your <b>DBT installer</b>, whether on CD or downloaded from Duxbury. If you have the DBT distribution CD in your computer, this location might be D:\dbt-1103.msi. But it is up to you to know the exact volume letter and path. Second, you need to know the location of the Shared License Service installer, a separate installer which is also on the distribution CD or downloaded from Duxbury (<a href="http://www.duxburysystems.com/downloads/duxsls-0100.msi"><span>http://www.duxburysystems.com/downloads/duxsls-0100.msi</span></a>, but note that the revision number of this installer file can change over time).</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You should know your <b>license text</b> and the maximum <b>number of DBT users</b> you are licensed for. The license text can usually be found on a print-and-braille card that came with your original purchase of DBT. It may also be found in a file called gjgmw.dxr or hjgmw.dxr that came with your original purchase of DBT if your first purchase was of version 10.4 or earlier. The number of users should be found on your purchase paperwork or other key documents relating to your installation.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You should verify that <b>TCP/IP port</b> 8080 is not already in use on your network, and will not be blocked by internal firewalls between the machines where DBT will be installed. This is the default port number that the Shared License Service uses. If port 8080 is not available or not suitable, then choose another port and pay close attention to the instructions about where to enter a custom port number.<br /></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Know your server’s <b>DNS name</b> in order to locate it from the client machines. If you do not have a DNS name, you can instead use the server’s IP address as long as it is a static IP number (i.e., not dynamically assigned and therefore changeable over time). On the server, use <code>ipconfig /all &lt;Enter&gt;</code> to find out its DNS name. Use <code>ping server-name &lt;Enter&gt;</code> on the client machines to verify that the client machines can locate the server with that name. (In this example, replace “server-name” with the actual name of your server machine.)<br />Note: Do not use a dynamic IP address, or your DBT clients will only work until the next time the server is rebooted!</li>
