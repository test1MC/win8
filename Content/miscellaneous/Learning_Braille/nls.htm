        <p class="Normal">The "Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribers," is a publication of the Library of Congress, National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS). The intermediate levels are expressed as section numbers within that document. When you choose a section, only the contractions introduced through that section are used in the translation to braille. Some of the sections are subdivided for convenience in following customary courses of instruction. Specifically, the contractions introduced at each higher level are given, by section, in the following list: </p>
