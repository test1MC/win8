        <p>Graduated tables are braille translation tables in DBT that are used to support teachers who are working with new braille readers in a specific professionally-developed curriculum. These braille translation tables do not implement a formal braille code, as defined by a braille authority.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Braille:Teaching" />Rather, each generally supports a subset of a defined braille code; the subset is defined by educators, who have worked out a system for teaching braille reading. Usually, this means that letters and more-commonly used symbols are taught first. Less-commonly used symbols and contractions are taught later.</p>
        <p>DBT can facilitate the production of your own supporting materials, custom-made for your student(s). But DBT's Graduated Tables feature is not intended to be used except to support you and your use of a professionally-developed curriculum for teaching braille reading.</p>
        <p>Currently, DBT has Graduated Tables to support three curricula:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="Braille:Learning" />The "Fingerprint" braille learning course is used to introduce contracted British Braille.</li>
            <li>The "Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribers," is a publication of the Library of Congress, National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS). The intermediate levels are expressed as section numbers within that document.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:keyword term="TSBVI" />An English/American instructional series available is the "Clusters" series developed by the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI).</li>
        </ul>
