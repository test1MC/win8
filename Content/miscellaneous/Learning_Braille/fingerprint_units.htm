        <h5>What is Fingerprint?</h5>
        <p>Fingerprint is a program to introduce new readers to braille.</p>
        <p>Fingerprint introduces braille symbols in units. When a new reader is using the Fingerprint program, it is important not to give that reader braille that uses braille symbols that have not yet been reinforced.</p>
        <p>Here is some technical data about Fingerprint:</p>
        <h5>How does DBT support Fingerprint?</h5>
        <p>DBT can be used to help you produce customised reading and reinforcement materials for your student, by transcribing text to braille using only the contractions appropriate for the Fingerprint unit on which your student is working.</p>
        <p>Note that DBT is not intended to be used apart from a structured curriculum and supporting materials designed by the developers of Fingerprint. These are available from the RNIB.</p>
        <p>Nor does DBT automate special handling of punctuation marks and many indicators (e.g. the italic indicator). DBT can help you to prepare texts that automatically avoid the use of contractions. But avoiding other issues symbols not yet known to your student will mean sometimes avoiding certain symbols or text attributes in the source material. That is your responsibility. You can use the Unit listing below as a handy reminder of what has not yet been introduced to your student.</p>
        <p>DBT can be used to help produce equivalent materials in both double-spaced and single-spaced versions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To use the Fingerprint Series, you could first import or create a document using the "English/British - no capitals in literary" Template, then select "English/British (new - experimental)" in the Document: Translation Tables menu. Close the menu and return to the document.</li>
            <li>Re-open to the Document: Translation Tables menu, and select "Select Contractions..." at the bottom of the Translation Tables menu, to choose which unit to use. </li>
            <li>Once you have made these choices, you may generate a Template. (This is particularly useful if you plan to re-use the same Fingerprint Series unit in several documents.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>COMMENTS: A braille reading and writing course for newly-blinded adults. This is a self-instruction course which requires occasional tutorial support. It consists of eleven volumes of material and eleven audio cassettes. RNIB have produced Teachers' notes and tapescripts to help the teacher move around the course independently of the student.</p>
        <p>This course was evolved over several years of teaching college students of average ability, so it has been well tested and it is thought that it could be of help to older adults as well. The materials consist of a teacher's manual, eleven training volumes together with a teaching tape for each. Self-help is encouraged but some direct teaching is also needed. Emphasis is laid on learning the correct use of touch and good techniques in writing. Good reading habits are encouraged by the provision of tracking exercises at the beginning of the scheme and the use of double spacing immediately followed by the same material in single spacing. This is intended to encourage fluent reading. Rules are introduced as they are needed. Words and sentences are followed by story paragraphs often involving the day by day activities of two people. At the end of each volume there is a page for timing speed and a twenty-sentence exercise.</p>
