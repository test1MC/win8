        <h4>Special Characters</h4>
        <p><b>Warning:</b> As well as being a rather technical Topic, screen reader users should expect unusual results when viewing the accompanying tables, because they essentially provide a partial list of <a href="../../POPUPS/Unicode.htm" target="_popup">Unicode</a> characters.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Some characters in this section may not display. This is entirely dependent on the version of Windows you are running, and what Fonts are installed. As a general rule of thumb, if a character will not display here, it will not display in documents within DBT or other programs on this computer either.</p>
        <h5>Word for Windows:</h5>
        <p>Many Word files are using special characters for things such as bullet boints, and even telephone symbols, such as ☎ ✄ ☀ ♬. Please familiarize yourself with DBT's Global: Word Importer Hex Value option in order to assist in identifying the Unicode value of such characters.</p>
        <p>See also: <a href="../../working_with_word/Word_Missing_or_wrong_characters.htm">Troubleshooting: Word - Missing or wrong characters</a>.</p>
