            <MadCap:keyword term="Unicode:What is" />Unicode - What is it?</h3>
        <p>This topic could well prove invaluable to you. If you are not familiar with the name "Unicode", please at least read this initial explanation.</p>
        <p>Unicode refers to individual print characters, or what they refer to as"Glyphs". If you are reading this, you will know that English contains 26 lower case letters, and 26 upper case letters, as well as 10 numbers, punctuation signs and various others. All of these are accessible to you on your keyboard.</p>
        <p>But of course there are other alphabets such as Arabic, Cyrillic and Greek. Add to that a multiplicity of other signs used in mathematics, chemistry, etc..</p>
        <p>Believe it or not there are now over 100,000 unique glyphs.</p>
        <p>It is quite obvious that even if we were able to develop a keyboard using just the characters many of us need on a fairly regular basis, it would be a confusingly large one. There are however many add-on programs which can assist, such as <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype?utm_nooverride=1&amp;gclid=CLqeia-JncACFStk7AodSgYAnw">MathType</a>, which allows an easier means of creating mathematical material within a Word document.</p>
        <h4 class="normal">Unicode Lists.</h4>
        <p>You will find a number of lists of Unicode Characters currently supported by DBT in <a href="Special_Characters/special_characters.htm">Special Characters</a></p>
        <h4 class="normal">Keyboard Input (Word)</h4>
        <p>There is a method to input a special character in Word. Type the Unicode value which appears in the list, and then immediately hold down the left Alt Key and tap the letter X. (Note that while on some keyboards the left and right Alt keys are identical, the right Alt key on some may carry the legend "Alt Gr". On these, it allows the creation of a third character.)</p>
        <p>For example, if you look at the <a href="Special_Characters/Unicode_26xx.htm">(U+26xx) - Miscellaneous Symbols</a> Topic, you will see some interesting symbols related to weather, etc.. If I wanted to include a sun, I would therefore type 2600 followed by Alt x and I would see a ☀ appear.</p>
        <h4 class="normal">Keyboard Input (DBT)</h4>
        <p>You will notice that the table above contains a column called DUSCI. And this shows "FF30" for the sun. Hence if you wish to input this character directly in to DBT, hold down the Ctrl key and tap the ] key (Right Square Bracket). Type ff30 into the dialog and press OK. This character will now be put into your DBT document.</p>
        <p>What appears when translated into braille?</p>
        <p>Where there is an official braille sign for a print symbol, that is what will appear in braille.</p>
        <p>If there is no formal braille sign, you will find the Description appears, in this case, "black sun with rays".</p>
