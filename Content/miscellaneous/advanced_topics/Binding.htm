        <h4>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding" />Binding</h4>
        <p>Whether we have just a few sheets of printed braille, hundreds, or even thousands, you may want to bind the material together for convenience.</p>
        <p>If you intend binding your braille sheets, allowances will need to be made to avoid printing where you intend to bind.</p>
        <p>You will need to know how much room to leave for binding before going on to Global Setup. Remember too that this may have a bearing on how many characters can be printed on each sheet of paper.</p>
        <h5>Single or Double Sided:</h5>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding margin" />Terms vary, but generally speaking, if you are binding single sided braille, the unprinted space on the left hand side is referred to as the "binding margin."</p>
        <p>If you are printing on both sides of the page, the space left for binding is called the "gutter." In DBT, the space left for binding is called a "Binding Margin"</p>
        <p>regardless of whether the document is single- or double-sided.</p>
        <p>Individual circumstances vary according to cost, local requirements, etc. Here we briefly describe some of the more popular methods of binding.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Staple (Side or corner)" />Staple (Side or Corner):</h5>
        <p>Stapling is the cheapest and simplest binding method. Sheets can either be stapled in the top left corner, or down the left hand side. This is OK for 2 - 10 sheets.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Staple (Magazine)" />Staple (Magazine Style):</h5>
        <p>Some embossers (printers) will print 4 pages at a time onto extra wide paper. For example, with a 12 page document, the embosser will print pages 1, 2, 11 &amp; 12, then 3, 4, 9 &amp; 10, and finally 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8. A heavy duty stapler is used to place a staple in the "centerfold", after which the document is folded. Normally a maximum of 40-50 sheets can be stapled this way.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Treasury Tagging" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Treasury Tagging" />Treasury Tagging:</h5>
        <p>This method utilizes the sprocket holes at the edge of the paper to keep sheets together.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Ring Binding" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Ring" />Ring Binding:</h5>
        <p>2, 3 or 4 holes are pre-punched in the paper. After the sprocket holed section has been removed, sheets can then be filed in normal commercial ring binders.</p>
        <p>Punching can also be done manually.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Comb" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Comb Binding" />Comb Binding:</h5>
        <p>Paper is pre-punched with oblong holes down one side. After removal of the sprocket holed section, sheets can be bound using plastic "combs."</p>
        <p>Comb binder punching can also be done manually.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Wiro" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Wiro Binding" />Wiro Binding:</h5>
        <p>"Wiro" is a popular proprietary form of binding, especially in braille library environments.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Saddle Stitch" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Saddle Stitch;Binding:Saddle Stitch" />Saddle Stitch:</h5>
        <p>This is similar to magazine style stapling, but here strong thread is used instead of staples.</p>
        <h5>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Binding:Perfect" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Perfect Binding" />Perfect Binding:</h5>
        <p>This method is similar to that used for binding paperback books. However, it does not lend itself easily to binding braille pages.</p>
