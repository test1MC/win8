        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> switches to "grade 1" Moon, as defined in the Transcribers Instruction Manual. (Note that some contractions, such as "and," are used even in grade 1.)</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> switches to "grade 2" Moon (the normal mode), where all contractions are used.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g0.5]</span> switches to "grade one-half," where all words are fully spelled out. (Note that the character after the "g" is the digit zero.)</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[/]</span> may be embedded within letter-groups that would normally be contracted, to prevent the contraction.</p>
        <p>Other translation codes will generally be ignored, or may cause unpredictable translation results.</p>
