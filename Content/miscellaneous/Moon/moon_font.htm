        <p>DBT will make selective use of the RNIB Moon font, when installed. Please note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The RNIB Moon font must be installed. It can be found at <a href="http://www.moonliteracy.org.uk/font.htm">http://www.moonliteracy.org.uk/font.htm</a>.</li>
            <li>If the RNIB Moon font is not installed, there is no change in DBT behavior. We will still translate Moon documents, but they will be shown in Braille/SimBraille/Print font, as preferred.</li>
            <li>If the RNIB Moon font is installed, it is used in place of Braille or SimBraille (but not Print fonts) whenever Moon text is to be shown; that is, whenever print text, translated through a Moon table, is to be shown.</li>
            <li>The DBT cursor appears to me to be poorly aligned for the RNIB Moon font. It can cause stems to disappear at the current cursor location.</li>
            <li>Support includes display of documents and translated line. Codes, shown in coded view, are not affected. Printing of Moon documents in the RNIB Moon font is also supported.</li>
            <li>Search/Replace dialogs do not currently support the RNIB Moon font.</li>
        </ul>
