        <h3 class="normal">Hyperlinks</h3>
        <p>The following is a useful tip when copying from web pages which contain hyperlinks not required in braille.</p>
        <p>"I received a Word file from a teacher where she had cut and pasted material from a website. The file looked perfectly normal, so I sorted out the formatting in Word, imported it into DBT, translated and checked it through.</p>
        <p>"I found a number of web links embedded in the braille which did not appear in the Word document, and were not wanted.</p>
        <p>"Investigation led me to use &lt;Alt&gt;-F9 in Word, which then showed a number of hyperlink entries which were obviously coming through into DBT.</p>
        <p>"Further investigation on how to remove these I found that by selecting ALL in Word, then pressing &lt;ctrl&gt;-&lt;shift&gt;-F9, all hyperlink references were removed and everything was OK when translated in DBT.</p>
        <p>"Thus my observation is:</p>
        <p>"If you find computer material in a braille file which you do not necessarily want, check the original Word document for hyperlinks (toggle &lt;Alt&gt;-F9), and if you wish to remove these, select the document (or section) and press &lt;ctrl&gt;-&lt;shift&gt;-F9."</p>
        <p>Thank you, [Name and country removed]!</p>
