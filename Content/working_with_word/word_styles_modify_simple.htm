        <h1>Modifying Styles</h1>
        <p>There are two keyboard means of accessing Styles to change the visual appearance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Open Apply Styles task pane. Ctrl+Shift+S</li>
            <li>Open Styles task pane. Alt+Ctrl+Shift+S</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first (Ctrl+shift+S) is generally used where a style has been applied already, but you wish to change its visual appearance. </p>
        <p>Note that your cursor MUST be inside the text of the Style you wish to modify.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/working_with_word/word_apply_style_simple.jpg" title="Apply Style dialog (Simple)" alt="Apply Style dialog (Simple)" style="width: 206px;height: 122px;" />
        </p>
        <p>This is a very simple dialog. It contains a drop down list box with the Title "Style Name:" If your cursor has been placed correctly, the name of the Style will be displayed. In the example above it shows that we will be amending "Heading 1".</p>
        <p>There are three buttons; Reapply, Modify... and Styles.</p>
        <p>And finally a Check Box called "AutoComplete style names" which is usually checked by default.</p>
        <p>For now, we are only going to click on the "Modify..." button which brings up the dialog described next.  You can, if you wish, simply use the second command and go directly to the actual Modify Style dialog.</p>
        <p>The second command (Alt+Ctrl+Shift+S) is where we will be making the actual changes, and initially may look quite a complex dialog. However, we will only be making minor changes at the moment.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/working_with_word/word_style_modify_dialog.jpg" title="Word's Modify Style Dialog" alt="Word's Modify Style Dialog" style="width: 380px;height: 390px;" />
        </p>
        <p>As you tab, or shift tab, though this dialog, descriptions of each element should be spoken.</p>
        <p>We are going to concentrate on the "Formatting|" section for now which os on two lines</p>
        <p>The first elemnt here is a drop down list which allows you to select the Font you wish to use for your Style.</p>
        <p>Next is a drop down list which allows you to select the size of the Font in Points.</p>
        <p>Three icons which visually appear are, B (Bold), I (Italics) and U (Underline). When you have tabbed onto one of these, the Enter key toggles the contol attribute on or off.</p>
        <p>And finally there is a control to allow selection of color. (Normally it is best left at "Automatic", which will usually produce black in print.</p>
        <p>On the next line are four groups of controls.</p>
        <p>The first is for the alignment of the text. It can be Left,Center, Right aligned or Justified. Justfied is where text is aligned to both the left and right margins as is seen on newspapers and books.</p>
        <p>The second group allows lines in a paragraph to have more space between them.</p>
        <p>Third group of two icons allows you to increase or decrease the space between paragraphs.</p>
        <p>The next major elent is a summary describing the Style in words so far.</p>
        <p>Now for the important part, and you have to make a serious decision here.</p>
        <p>Do you want your changes to apply just to this document, or to all documents?</p>
        <p>First time around, we would suggest you test things with an existing document until you are happy with how things look.</p>
        <p>The first control is a check box labelled "Add to Quick Style List". This is an item in the ribbon which displays Styles you may wish to use regularyl. Is is checked by default and is principally an aid for sighted users.</p>
        <p>"Automatically Update" is a check box. This may be left as it is for now.</p>
        <p>Finally two radio buttons. "Only in this document" and "New documents based on this template".</p>
        <p>There is now a button labelled "Format". &#160;We will cover this in another topic.</p>
        <p>If you are happy with your changes, click the OK&#160;button. If not, there is a Cancel button.</p>
