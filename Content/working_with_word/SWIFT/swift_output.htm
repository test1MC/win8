        <p>Three Output options allow you to Emboss Direct, Open in DBT and Print Braille. The output goes to whatever you have set up as your default in DBT itself.</p>
        <p>One of the main features here is that in Word, you can select a section of a document, and have only that section output, as opposed to the whole document.</p>
        <p>Moreover, you can even select non-contiguous sections of text in your Word document if you wish, and only those sections will be output.</p>
        <p>If you have a blank document in Word, you will not be able to print or emboss, since it is an obvious waste of paper. However you can "Open in DBT".</p>
