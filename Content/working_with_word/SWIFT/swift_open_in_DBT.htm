        <h2 class="chapter">Open in DBT</h2>
        <p>When you select this option from within Word, it will open the same file in DBT.</p>
        <p>If your Word file has not been saved, you will get the following warning prompting you to save the file before bringing it into DBT.</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/working_with_word/swift/swift_word_file_not_saved.jpg" title="Image of warning asking if you wish to save you file before brining in to DBT." alt="Image of warning asking if you wish to save you file before brining in to DBT." />
        </p>
        <p>You may either select the Cancel button to return to Word, or click the OK button to save the file as you would normally in Word.</p>
        <h5 class="normal">Template Name is save automatically.</h5>
        <p>Please note that the DBT Template Name will be saved within the actual Word File. Therefore if you open the Word file at a later date, that is the DBT Template which will be used.</p>
        <h5 class="normal">Open a Selection.</h5>
        <p>If you wish to open just a selection of text, you may see the following dialog appear. The appearance or otherwise can be changed using <a href="swift_options.htm">SWIFT Options</a> and check or uncheck, "Always use document Selection for DBT".</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/working_with_word/swift/swift_Word_selection.jpg" title="Confirm just Selection or whole document." alt="Confirm just Selection or whole document." />
