        <p>Microsoft's Word for Windows is one of the most commonly used (and yet least understood) text editors world-wide. Sadly many users are simply not given any training in its use.</p>
        <p>What we hope to do here is to show you some tips which will assist in preparing documents which can be opened in DBT, leaving little or no extra work to be done when the Word document is opened in DBT. Moreover, many address the all important issue of saving you valuable time.</p>
        <p>It may also come as a surprise to learn that many of these tips equally apply to preparing Word documents which may be required in other alternative formats such as large print, accessible <MadCap:popup><MadCap:popupHead>PDF</MadCap:popupHead><MadCap:popupBody>Portable Document Format</MadCap:popupBody></MadCap:popup> files, and even e-books.</p>
        <p>While we have tried to cover the main issues regarding using Word with the Duxbury Braille Translator (DBT) here, the author has found many useful hints, tips and advice about Word for Windows at <a href="http://wordribbon.tips.net/" target="_blank">http://wordribbon.tips.net/</a>.</p>
        <p>If you have an older version of Word which uses menus instead of a ribbon, go to  <a href="http://word.tips.net/" target="_blank">http://word.tips.net/</a>.</p>
