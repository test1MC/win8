        <h4>Scientific Notebook</h4>
        <p><b>Duxbury Systems supports Scientific Notebook 5.5, which is still available as a download. The new version, Scientific Notebook 6.0, is not compatible with DBT at this time.</b>
        </p>
        <p><i>(This topic should really not be under Word, since Scientific Notebook creates its own files. However as it covers a means of producing mathematical braille, we have placed it here for completeness.)</i>
        </p>
        <p>This is a popular product in many areas which essentially produces LaTeX files.</p>
        <p>A 30 day demonstration version may be obtained from: <a href="http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?products/dnloadreq.html">http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?products/dnloadreq.html</a></p>
        <p>The files produced by Scientific Notebook may be imported into DBT and translated accordingly.</p>
