        </p>
        <p>MathType is a relatively low-cost add-on for Word for Windows which enables mathematical formulae to be inserted into Word for Windows documents. It is produced by <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/">Design Science, Inc.</a>. Word documents containing MathType equations can be opened in DBT, and translated into mathematical braille.</p>
        <p>However, it must be stressed that the preparation of mathematical material should only be done by those with a good knowledge and understanding of mathematics.</p>
        <p>Modern day mathematical editors make extensive use of Unicode for many mathematical signs. Unfortunately, visually, many signs appear alike or similar. Unfortunately also we have become used to using purely the PC's keyboard for inputting many arithmetical or mathematical characters.</p>
        <p class="center">

        </p>
        <p>For example, two times two equals four, is often shown as: "<b>2x2=4</b>".</p>
        <p>With correct mathematical input it should appear as "<b>2×2=4</b>".</p>
        <p>(And if you are still wondering what the difference is, it is the <b>x</b> (as in x-ray) which, in the second example is <b>×</b> a proper multiplication sign.)</p>
        <p>Fortunately MathType's features allow you to easily select the correct characters, provided of course you know what you require.</p>
        <p><b>WARNING</b>
        </p>
        <p>All flavors of Word in common use, allow you to embed either fonts used, or entire character sets.</p>
        <p>HOWEVER, this does NOT apply to fonts within embedded MathType Equations.</p>
        <p>MathType installs certain fonts specific to itself which Design Science refer to as, "our exclusive Euclid™ math fonts". Consequently users should be warned about sharing files with others who do not have MathType installed. Some users may be lucky if they have a wealth of more complete Unicode character sets installed, but this tends to be the exception in our (UK) educational system</p>
        <p>The short term (sighted only) solution is to create a PDF and pass that around. However that rather defeats the purpose of sharing work.</p>
        <p>The alternative short term answer is to advise the installation of the MathType 30 day fully working demo software.</p>
        <h2>Adding equations</h2>
        <p>This is a very simple process. Let us say we want to insert the following equation into Word:</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/equation_1.jpg" alt="Image of Equation: minus b plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4c over 2a" title="Image of Equation: minus b plus or minus the root of b squared minus 4c over 2a" style="width: 314px;height: 140px;" />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;font-size: 28pt;">
            <MadCap:equation title="Fraction for Caryn to test for accessibility" alt="Fraction for Caryn to test for accessibility" style="font-size: 43pt;">$\frac{{ - b \pm \sqrt {{b^2} - 4ac} }}{{2a}}$</MadCap:equation>
        </p>
        <p>In Word, click on MathType, and then "Inline Equation" (Word 2003) or "Inline" Word 2007/2010). You will see the following dialog into which you enter your equation. When you have completed the equation, simply close the MathType window, and your equation will appear within Word.</p>
        <p>It is beyond the scope of this topic to fully explain how MathType is used, but suffice to say that the product does contain excellent documentation.</p>
