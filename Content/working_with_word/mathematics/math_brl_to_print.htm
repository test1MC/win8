        <h2>Mathematical Braille to Print</h2>
        <p>This is an entirely new feature and, to some extent, should be regarded as experimental.</p>
        <p>However initial tests suggest it to be well worth including here.</p>
        <p>There are currently two options which are described in detail here:</p>
