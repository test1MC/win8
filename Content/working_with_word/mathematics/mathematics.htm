        <p>A great deal of work has gone into the difficult subject of braille mathematics.</p>
        <p>Moreover it is not a subject which can be covered easily, since it does require a knowledge of mathematics as well as mathematical braille.</p>
        <p>Additionally one needs to know how to use at least one of two software products - <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/MathType/" title="Design Science web site" alt="Design Science web site">MathType</a> and/or <a href="http://www.mackichan.com/index.html" title="Mackichan web site" alt="Mackichan web site">Scientific Notebook</a>.</p>
        <p>And as a final warning, never was the saying "Rubbish In - Rubbish Out!" more true.</p>
        <p>You may, if you wish, prefer to input math directly into DBT. <a href="../../mathematics/DBT_Math_Direct_Entry.htm" title="DBT Math Direct Entry" alt="DBT Math Direct Entry">Click here</a> for a basic guide.</p>
        <h5>MathType</h5>
        <p>If you are familiar with Microsoft Word for Windows, you may also know of "Equation Editor" which allows you to insert basic mathematical material into a Word file. We do not recommend use of this due to the fact that it has not been updated for quite a while.</p>
        <p>MathType is a more advanced (but low cost) version of Equation Editor which enables you to enter equations into Word documents. The current version is <MadCap:variable name="Primary.MathType Current Cersion" /> and we would advise this version is used with <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />.</p>
        <p>Word files containing MathType equations may then be opened in DBT in the usual way, and translated into braille.</p>
        <p>A 30 day fully working demonstration version is available for download from: <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/MathType/trial.asp">http://www.dessci.com/en/products/MathType/trial.asp</a></p>
        <h5>Scientific Notebook</h5>
        <p>This product creates its own files containing both text and mathematical material. It is possibly slightly more advanced, which in turn is reflected in the cost.</p>
        <p>Scientific Notebook files will be recognized as such when you open them in DBT.</p>
        <p>A 30 day demonstration version is also available from:<a href="http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?products/dnloadreq.html">http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?products/dnloadreq.html</a></p>
        <h5>New Math Features in DBT</h5>
        <p>DBT has a series of new features to facilitate getting math the way you want it. See <a href="../../welcome_to_DBT/External_Links/math.htm">Use of Math Improvements</a></p>
