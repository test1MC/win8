        <h3>Braille Formatted file containing UEB text/Nemeth math to Inkprint Math</h3>
        <p>A braille formatted file is a file containing the ASCII characters used to stand for braille laid out in a file the same way a braille page is laid out. Here is a sample file:</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">,! quadratic =mula says3</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">,if _% ax^2"+bx+c .k #0 _:1 !n</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">_% x .k ?-a+-&gt;b^2"-4ac]/2a# _:4</p>
        <p>Our first goal is to add <span class="Code-DuxScreen">_%_:</span> or <span style="font-family: SimBraille; font-size: 18pt;">_%_:</span> near the top of the file, so it looks like this:</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">_%_: ,! quadratic =mula says3</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">,if _% ax^2"+bx+c .k #0 _:1 !n</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">_% x .k ?-a+-&gt;b^2"-4ac]/2a# _:4</p>
        <p>The extra 4 characters (shown here at the very beginning of the file) mean nothing. They say go into math, then go back to text. But they allow DBT to know you want Nemeth Code braille translated into inkprint. Notice that the braille uses two characters to go into math and two braille characters to go back to text. Your braille file must follow this pattern.</p>
        <p>Import the file into DBT, using the "UEB (English) - BANA with Nemeth" DBT Template. Do not accept the default file type of "Braille Formatted File". Instead move down on position to select "Formatted Pre-UEB to Print". Once the file is imported, it should be in inkprint.</p>
        <p>To produce this file in inkprint, use one of the two sets of instructions found below.</p>
        <h6>1) Save As to Word, get MathType Equations</h6>
        <p>To follow these instructions, you need to have a copy of Microsoft Word installed, plus a copy of <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/">MathType by Design Science</a>. Both of these programs cost money.</p>
        <p>From DBT's file menu, select <span class="Code-DuxScreen">Save As...</span>, specify the new name for your file, and choose <span class="Code-DuxScreen">Word Document </span>as the File type.</p>
        <p>Now launch Word. Open the newly created file. Use control-A to select All. From the MathType Menu, choose <b>Publish</b>, then choose <b>Toggle TeX</b>. You should see the entire file change to show text and math equations. You can now print out math equations and text which, depending on how you created your file, might have been in braille a minute or so ago.</p>
        <p>If the <b>Toggle TeX</b> option is greyed out, it indicates the process of producing this file has hit a snag. One user reports that saving the Word file, closing Word, and then re-launching Word allows many files to "work". Your mileage may vary. The problem might be caused by an error in the text (such as starting a square root and not ending it), or a program bug in DBT. If you need help, send the source *.dxp file as an e-mail attachment to languages@duxsys.com.</p>
        <h6>2) Save As to LaTeX, get Scientific Notebook or Scientific Viewer Equations</h6>
        <p>To follow these instructions, you need to have a copy of <a href="http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?products/dnloadreq.html">Scientific Notebook</a> or <a href="http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?products/sv.html~mainFrame">Scientific Viewer</a> installed, Scientific Viewer is freeware, Scientific Notebook costs money.</p>
        <p>From DBT's file menu, select <span class="Code-DuxScreen">Save As...</span>, specify the new name for your file, and choose <span class="Code-DuxScreen">LaTeX</span> as the File type.</p>
        <p>Now launch Scientfic Notebook or Scientific Viewer. Open the newly created file. You should see the entire file as text and math equations. You can now print out math equations and text which, depending on how you created your file, might have been in braille a minute or so ago.</p>
        <p>If you do not get what you expected, it indicates the process of producing this file has hit a snag. This might be caused by an error in the text (such as starting a square root and not ending it), or a program bug in DBT. If you need help, send the source *.dxp file as an e-mail attachment to <a href="../../embossers_and_embossing/Codes/Codes_General/OneByOne.htm">languages@duxsys.com</a>.</p>
