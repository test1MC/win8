            <MadCap:keyword term="Codes:Using DBT Codes in Word" />Using DBT Codes in Word</h4>
        <p>This may on the face of it appear to be a fairly technical topic. Indeed to some extent it is. However, it may be useful in cases where transcribers prefer to use Word for Windows.</p>
        <p>In order to fully understand this topic, you should be familiar with DBT's Codes as described in the <a href="../Templates_Styles_Codes/Codes/codes.htm">Codes</a> Topics. To use the AutoText method mentioned here, you should also be comfortable with working in Microsoft's Word for Windows.</p>
        <p>It is possible to insert or embed DBT Codes into Word Documents. All that is required is that you enter the Code into the Word document between a double left square bracket and an asterisk, and an asterisk and a double right square bracket. <b>[[*code*]]</b></p>
        <p>For example, the Code used in DBT to skip one a line is <span class="Code-DuxCode">[sk1]</span>. To put this Code in Word, type <b>[[*sk1*]]</b>. When you then import you file into DBT, you will find the Code you typed in Word, has become a regular DBT Code, and in this example, will skip a line in braille.</p>
        <p>This method is fine for relatively basic Coding, but has two drawbacks. First, it may be considered rather cumbersome to type, and second it does alter the appearance of your Word Document, with the added possible side-effect that the pagination may be altered.</p>
        <p>However, you can "Hide" this extraneous text. Moreover, you can use one of Word's less used features, AutoText, to create a list of Codes you wish to use on a regular basis.</p>
