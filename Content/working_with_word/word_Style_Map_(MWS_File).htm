            <MadCap:keyword term="Import" />When DBT imports a file from Word for Windows, it will recognize any default Styles applied to the text in Word, and apply appropriate DBT Braille Styles.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Heading" />For example Word's "Heading 1" Style, will become DBT's "h1." heading Style in DBT. </p>
        <p>This potentially gives you tremendous control over how imported Word documents are formatted, and can save you literally hours of work.</p>
        <p>If a document contains User Defined Word Styles, DBT will not know about them. You can however use a utility called <a href="SWIFT\swift.htm"><MadCap:keyword term="SWIFT" />SWIFT</a>, which may already have been installed on your system in Word, to map User Styles to DBT Styles.</p>
        <p>Details for using SWIFT are available in DBT's main Help system.</p>
        <p>If you are following <a href="../POPUPS/Braille_Authority_of_North_America.htm" target="_popup">BANA</a> braille formatting and rules, you may alternatively use the "Braille" Template in Word, which may be installed on your system. See the Help Topic called "<a href="BANA_Template_2014/Word_Template_BANA_Braille_2014.htm">Word Template (BANA Braille 2014)</a>" for a full explanation.</p>

            <MadCap:keyword term="Duxbury:Templates" />Experienced users may however prefer to create and maintain their own Word Style Map files, which are containing in the c:\duxbury\templates folder, and have the file extension ".mws". For details on how these files work, please see "<a href="editing_mws.htm">Editing the ".mws" file</a>" Topic.</p>
