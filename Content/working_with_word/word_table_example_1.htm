        <h1>Handling a Wide Table</h1>
        <p>This example answers a question recently posed by a young user who urgently needed to study the information in a Word table which was extremely wide (18 columns) but only 5 rows.</p>
        <p>A screen shot of the file is shown below, or you can open the file if you have Word installed by <a href="Word_wide_table.docx">clicking here</a>. (Note that the table is in Dutch.)</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/working_with_word/word_wide_table_example.jpg" alt="Image4 of the very wide table.  (The table is in Dutch)" />
        </p>
        <p>In this case, there is relatively little information in each cell, which does help.</p>
        <p>Rather than trying to reformat the table in Word (prior to opening in DBT), we simply opened it in DBT.</p>
        <p>Next, please ensure that you move the cursor into the actual Table in DBT.</p>
        <p>Then open DBT's Table menu, and select Properties,</p>
        <p>The following image shows part of the result. It also shows DBT's Table:&#160;Properties dialog which we will explain next.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/working_with_word/word_wide_table_example_dxp1.jpg" alt="Image shows DBT's Table: Properties selection list" />
        </p>
        <p>All you have to do in the Table Propeties dialog is:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Leave the Table type: as Automatic</li>
            <li>Change the drop down list X/Y (Row/Column)&#160;Swap: to "Force Swap".</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will now see your screen change as shown next.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/working_with_word/word_wide_table_example_dxp2.jpg" alt="Image now it's X Y co-ordinates swapped, and before transation into braille" />
        </p>
        <p>What we have essentially done is to turn the table through 90 degrees such that the Titles in the original left hand row becomes Column Headings.</p>
        <p>When you now Translate into braille, you will find the result below showing a much more understandable table to the reader. (Note that only the first of the five new columns is shown here.)</p>
