        <h3 class="normal">What is a Style?</h3>
        <p>Styles are one of the single most important elements to understand the use of. Let us begin with one very simple example.</p>
        <p><b>Headings:</b> Many documents, especially books, have Chapter&#160;headings. Let us look at how you might deal with the following:</p>
        <p class="CourierPara">Chapter One – Introduction.</p>
        <p class="CourierPara">My story begins in Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland.</p>
        <p class="CourierPara">Chapter Two - Education.</p>
        <p class="CourierPara">The Royal High School sat on Calton Hill with the facade of a Greek Temple overlooking Arthur's Seat.</p>
        <p>Many users highlight the chapter headings, change the Font size to a larger one, and perhaps make the text Bold. Quite a few keystrokes and/or mouse clicks, especially when you have many chapters to apply this to.</p>
        <p>And that is exactly what DBT sees when the file is opened in DBT. It ignores the font size, but recognizes Bold, and therefore may show the Bold on - Bold off indicators in braille. Text will also begin in cell 3.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, you could place your cursor on the chapter heading line, and either hold down the Control and Alt keys together and press the number 1 - or - Click on <b>Heading 1</b> in Word's Quick Style Ribbon. Your Heading will now look something like this:</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 14pt;color: #0000ff;">Chapter One – Introduction.</p>
        <p>Now when opened in DBT, this will have DBT's "h1." Style automatically applied, and will now correctly place the Heading in the center of the braille line, followed by a blank line.</p>
        <p>Even if the author is not aware of what alternative outputs may be created afterwords, there are three good reasons for using Word's styles properly.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Fewer Steps are required to create the Heading.</li>
            <li>Changing Styles, such as Heading 1 here, can be changed in appearance in the entire document in one simple dialog. (And indeed can be changed for all new documents if wished.)</li>
            <li>A Table of Contents can be created in quite literally seconds.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We will cover this in more details in separate Topics.</p>
