        <h1>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Registration;Activation" />Registration and Activation</h1>
        <p>What are these steps? <b>Registration</b> provides your contact information to Duxbury Systems, connecting you with your license, which allows you to receive customer support. </p>
        <p>Activation is something different. <b>Activation</b> turns on the full feature set of your DBT. For example, you cannot produce actual, valid Braille output without activating first. In order to activate, you need your license, and you need to have administrative privileges on your computer. If you do not, you will need help from your IT department.</p>
        <p>Both Registration and Activation can be done using the Activation Wizard.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">DBT provides two places where you can enter the Activation Wizard. If you have installed and not yet activated<MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" /> you will see the following splash screen when you start the program.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">(NOTE: The License Number shown in the screen shot is for illustrative purposes only!)</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version" class="center">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/activation_wizard/DBT_11.3_splash_activation.jpg" alt="Image of the Dubury Splash Screen showing the Activate button" title="Image of the Dubury Splash Screen showing the Activate button" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { width: 424px;height: 278px; }" />
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">The second access point for activation is from the <a href="../the_menus/MENU_HELP/help_about_dbt.htm" title="Help: About DBT..." alt="Help: About DBT...">Help: About DBT...</a> dialog, which likewise provides an Activate button. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Primary.Print_Only">( <MadCap:xref href="../the_menus/MENU_HELP/help_about_dbt.htm" class="ListOfPageNumber">See "Help: About DBT"</MadCap:xref>.)</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">When you click on the Activate button, you will be taken to the Activation Wizard.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mac_Version">DBT for the Macintosh provides a "Licensing and Activation..." menu item under the Help menu. This opens the licensing agreement dialog (which you should read at least once), but it also provides a checkbox to "Run Activation Wizard when this dialog is closed." When you check this box, the Run Wizard... button appears, allowing you to enter the Activation Wizard. You can both Register and Activate using the wizard.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version"><b>Notes</b>: (1) DBT also provides a Registration... item under the Help menu, but registering using the Activation Wizard is easier. In fact, if you activate first, the wizard will give you the option to register at the same time. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">(2) For a new installation, DBTdoes allow a 45-day grace period before activation must be done on a permanent basis. Duxbury recommends you proceed to normal activation right away, regardless of the grace period, so as to avoid confusion later.</p>
        <h3>The Activation Wizard</h3>
        <p>You will now see the Duxbury Activation Wizard "Welcome"screen:</p>

        </p>
        <p>When you click "Next", a screen similar to the following will appear.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">Not all options shown below appear under all circumstances. Do not be concerned if your wizard display differs slightly.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version"><b>Note</b>: When you select activation (or de-activation), the Activation Wizard automatically invokes the User Account Control prompt, where you can enter a user name and password as needed.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mac_Version"><b>Note</b>: When you select activation (or de-activation), the Activation Wizard displays the Macintosh lock icon. Click this icon and enter your name and password to unlock the operation.</p>

        <p>The Activation Wizard will lead you through activating and registering your DBT. The easiest method is through an internet connection, but the wizard will offer you other ways to activate if you do not have, or cannot use, your internet connection.</p>
