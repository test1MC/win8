        <p>The screen below shows the result of running diagnostic tests. In addition to the test results, this screen provides these two commands:</p>
        <p><b>View Log:</b> This button opens Windows Notepad and displays the activation log, which may assist Duxbury Technical Support staff to identify the problem you are having.</p>
        <p><b>Send Email:</b> If you have an e-mail program installed, this button creates an e-mail message addressed to Duxbury with the log file attached. You will need to then manually "send" the message as normal.</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">Note: In network installations of DBT, the Diagnostics report will differ depending on whether it is run on the network license host or on a client of the license host. Duxbury Technical Support can interpret the diagnostics in each of these two cases. For most network activation issues, diagnostics from the license host provide the more useful information.</p>
