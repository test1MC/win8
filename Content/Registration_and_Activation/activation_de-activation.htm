        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Remove DBT" />If for any reason you wish to remove DBT from your system (See <a href="../getting_setup_in_DBT/Remove_DBT.htm">Remove DBT</a>), perhaps to install it on a different system, you should deactivate DBT.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mac_Version">On the Macintosh, you deactivate using the Activation Wizard. You will find it by going to the Help menu and choosing, "Licensing and Activation..."</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">Access to this process is via the De-activate button found in DBT's <a href="../the_menus/MENU_HELP/Help_Menu.htm">Help: About DBT</a> dialog shown below.</p>
        <p align="center" class="center">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/the_menus/menu_help/menu_help_about_11.3.jpg" alt="Image shows the Help: About DBT screen. If you need to contact Duxbury for Technical Suport, you will be asked for your Version, Date, License Number all of which are contained inthis dialog" width="542px" height="443px" border="0" title="Image shows the Help: About DBT screen.

        </p>
        <p>You should ideally de-activate while connected to the Internet. This will ensure that your activation count is immediately adjusted on the Duxbury Activation Server.</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/activation_wizard/DBT_11.3_deactivation_code_file.jpg" alt="Image shows the icon which will appear on the Desktop named &quot;DBT Remove Code - do not delete.txt&quot;" style="width: 94px; height: 106px;" width="94" height="106" align="right" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>If you do not have an Internet connection available, please proceed anyway. A special de-activation text file will be copied to your desktop. This text file may then be e-mailed, faxed, or the details relayed by telephone to <a href="../getting_setup_in_DBT/new_users_start_here/GETTING_HELP.htm">Duxbury</a>. The adjustment to your user count will then be done manually.</p>
