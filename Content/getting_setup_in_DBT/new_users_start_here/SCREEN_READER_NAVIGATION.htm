        <h5><a name="CONTENTS"></a>Using The Table of Contents (Alt + c)</h5>
        <p>When you first open the DBT help system, the Table of Contents is displayed on the left side of a split window. The Table of Contents lists a number of books and pages. Books are categories containing a number of pages. The pages are topics containing information. <span class="Keyboard">Up Arrow</span> and <span class="Keyboard">Down Arrow</span> are used to move through the Table of Contents. <span class="Keyboard">Right Arrow</span> is used to open a book. <span class="Keyboard">Left Arrow</span> is used to close a book. Press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> on a selected page to access the text of that topic, and then press <span class="Keyboard">F6</span> to move to the topic window. Press <span class="Keyboard">F6</span> to return to the Table of Contents,or press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + c</span> to return to the Table of Contents from any section of the help system.</p>
        <h5><a name="INDEX"></a>Using the Index (Alt + n)</h5>
        <p>Press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + n</span> to move to the Index. Type in keywords to locate related topics. Keywords are help related terms or concepts. After typing in a keyword, press <span class="Keyboard">Up Arrow</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Down Arrow</span> to move through a list of matching index entries. Press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> to select a keyword. If there is only one matching topic, it is displayed in the topic window. Press <span class="Keyboard">F6</span> to move to the topic window. If there are multiple matching topics, they are displayed in a list. Select a topic from the list, press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>, then press <span class="Keyboard">F6</span> to move to the topic window.</p>
        <h5><a name="SEARCH"></a>Using Search (Alt + s)</h5>
        <p>Press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + s</span> to move to the Search page. Type in the word or phrase you are looking for, and then press <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> to move to the List Topics Button. Press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>, and then press <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> to move to the list of topics.</p>
        <p>Use the arrow keys to locate topics and press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> to open them. Press <span class="Keyboard">F6</span> to move to the topic window.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Search follows much the same rules as searching in Internet Explorer. If you type in a single word, it will normally find all topics containing that word. For example if you typed in the word <span class="Code-DuxScreen">font</span>, it would find many, many Topics containing that word. However, if you typed in <span class="Code-DuxScreen">braille font</span>, do not be surprised to find many more additional topics, since this would final all occurrences in topics of the word <b>braille</b> OR the word <b>font</b>. To narrow the search down, type the expression inside double quotes, i.e. <span class="Code-DuxScreen">"braille font"</span>. This will then only find Topics where the words, "braille font" appear as you have typed them.</p>
        <h5><b><a name="GLOSSARY"></a>Using the Glossary</b> (Alt + g)</h5>
        <p>Press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + g</span> to move to the Glossary. Focus is initially in a list of Terms. Type the first few characters of the term for which you are looking and/or Arrow through the list of terms. Once you have located the desired term, press <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> to move to the definition for that term. Press <span class="Keyboard">Insert + Down Arrow</span> to read the definition. Other JAWS reading commands can also be used. Press <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> again to return to the list of terms.</p>
        <h5><a name="FAVOURITES"></a><b>Using Favorites</b> (Alt + i)</h5>
        <p>Press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + i</span> to move to Favorites. Focus is initially on the list of Favorite Topics, however, when you first use Favorites, there will be none listed. Normally, you can arrow up and down the list to one of your choice. Press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + d</span> to display contents of the topic, then press <span class="Keyboard">F6</span> to move focus to the right hand window where the explanation is displayed.</p>
        <p>If you press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + u</span> you will arrive at a Text Box called "Current Topic". This normally displays the Topic you are currently focused on. If you would like to add this to your list of Favorites, type <span class="Keyboard">Alt + a</span>.</p>
        <p>If you decide you no longer wish an item to appear in your list, move to the item as described above, and press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + r</span>.</p>
        <h5><a name="TOPICPANE"></a><b>Reading the Topic Pane</b></h5>
        <p>To select a topic from the table of contents and move to the topic pane to read more, press <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> and then <span class="Keyboard">F6</span>.</p>
        <p>When reading the topic pane, you can use the keyboard commands that apply in your browser. Some examples are: the JAWS Continuous read command <span class="Keyboard">Insert + Down Arrow</span>; <span class="Keyboard">Alt + Left Arrow</span> to move back to a previous topic where applicable; <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Shift + Tab</span> to move to a link.</p>
        <p><span class="Keyboard">JawsKey </span>+<span class="Keyboard"> F6</span> for the list of headings in the topic; <span class="Keyboard">JawsKey </span>+<span class="Keyboard"> F7</span> for the list of links in the topic. You can also use the JAWS Find commands to find specific text in the topic. These commands are <span class="Keyboard">JawsKey </span>+<span class="Keyboard"> Shift </span>+<span class="Keyboard"> F</span>, and<span class="Keyboard"> F3</span> and<span class="Keyboard"> Shift + F3</span> to find further occurrences.</p>
        <p>Use <span class="Keyboard">F6</span> to switch back to the left pane. If, while reading a topic, you decide that you want to add it to your favorite topics list, simply press <span class="Keyboard">Alt + i</span>, <span class="Keyboard">Alt + a</span>, and <span class="Keyboard">F6</span>. This quick sequence brings up the favorites list, adds the current topic, and returns you to the reading pane. Navigating back to the topic will be much quicker in the future.</p>
        <h5><a name="CONVENTIONS"></a>Conventions</h5>
        <p>A shortcut key can be a single key on the keyboard or several keys that are pressed in combination. In this help system, the plus sign (+) indicates when keys are to be pressed in combination. For example, <span class="Keyboard">Insert + Right Arrow</span> can be used to read the next word in a document.</p>
        <p>Shortcut keys can also consist of sequences of pressed keys, where some keys are pressed and released, and then other keys are pressed. A comma (,) indicates when keys are to be pressed one after the other. For example: <span class="Keyboard">Alt + f</span>, <span class="Keyboard">x</span> can be used to close many applications. In this example, press <span class="Keyboard">Alt</span> and <span class="Keyboard">f</span> together, release the keys, and then press <span class="Keyboard">x</span>.</p>
        <p>When referring to shortcut keys that require the use of the number pad, the term "Num Pad" always precedes that shortcut key. For example: <span class="Keyboard">Insert + Num Pad 5</span>. If the shortcut key does not say "Num Pad", use the number from the number row.</p>
