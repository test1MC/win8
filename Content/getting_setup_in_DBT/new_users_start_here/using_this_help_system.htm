            <MadCap:keyword term="Help:Using;Using This Help System" />Using This Help system</h4>
        <p>This help system consists of five parts:</p>
        <p>The <b><u>C</u>ontents</b> tab works like a traditional table of contents. Topics are grouped by subject. Just double-click on a topic to view the topic in the right-hand frame.</p>
        <p>The <b>I</b><u>n</u><b>dex </b>tab allows you to search for a specific subject. Any topics with that index entry will appear, and you can select which one you want to view.</p>
        <p>The <b><u>S</u>earch</b> tab allows you to add topics, so you can come back to them at any time.</p>
        <p>The <b>Favor<u>i</u>tes</b> tab allows you to add Topics which you may want a quick way of coming back to.</p>
        <p>The <b><u>G</u>lossary</b> tab provides a list of short definitions of words and/or terms which you may find useful.</p>
        <p>Across the top is a series of Icons. From left to right they are:</p>
        <p><b>Hide</b> - which will hide the Table of Contents, thus widening the topic pane.</p>
        <p><b>Back</b> - takes you to the previously viewed Topic.</p>
        <p><b>Forward</b> - only active if you have used Back, and takes you forward again.</p>
        <p><b>Home</b> - Returns you to the beginning Help screen</p>
        <p><b>Print</b> - to print the Topic in view.</p>
        <p><b>Options</b> - provides a few customizing options.</p>
        <p><b>DBT Web Site</b> - Opens up Duxbury's web site in the Topic pane.</p>
        <p><b>Emboss</b> - Allows you to emboss the Topic in view.</p>
