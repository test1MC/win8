            <MadCap:keyword term="Installation;Installation:Simple;Simple Installation" />Simple Installation</h3>
        <p>Chances are that you can get DBT installed with only the instructions included in this topic, or, for that matter without any instructions at all. Installation of DBT should usually be as simple as inserting the CD and following the prompts. But this guide is included to help you as necessary along the way.</p>
        <h5>Step 1: Insert the CD</h5>
        <p>To get things started, insert the DBT product CD into a CD drive on your computer. After a moment, you should see a screen much like the following:</p>
        <p align="center" class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_12.1_Install_Welcome.JPG" title="DBT 12.1 Welcome Dialog" alt="DBT 12.1 Welcome Dialog" style="width: 364px;height: 276px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Simply click the Next button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>, to continue. If you wish to quit now, or when viewing any subsequent screen, click the Cancel button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Escape</span>. Your system will not be changed regardless of when you choose to cancel the installation.</p>
        <p>If, for whatever reason, inserting the CD does not cause the Installer Wizard to appear, then browse the CD contents for a file called <MadCap:variable name="Primary.MSIFile" /> and open it, then proceed as above.</p>
        <h5>Step 2: Read the License Agreement</h5>
        <p>Next, you will see a screen like the following:</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_12.1_License_Agreement.jpg" style="width: 346px;height: 262px;" title="End User License Agreement" alt="End User License Agreement with accept or reject radio buttons showing" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice that the Next button is initially disabled. In order to continue installation, you must accept the terms of the license agreement by selecting the radio button so labeled, or by typing <span class="Keyboard">Alt+A</span>. <b>If this is your first time installing <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />, we urge you to read the text first.</b> If you choose not to accept the agreement, you may cancel installation and contact your dealer or Duxbury Systems to return the software, within 90 days of your purchase.</p>
        <p>If you accept the license agreement, simply click Next, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>, to continue.</p>
        <h5>Step 3: Personalize your Installation</h5>
        <p>The next screen looks like this: </p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_12.1_customer_information.jpg" title="Customer Information dialog" alt="Customer Information dialog" style="width: 419px;height: 319px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Some parts of the dialog, the <MadCap:keyword term="Username" />User Name, <MadCap:keyword term="Organization" />Organization, and <MadCap:keyword term="License:Text" />License Text fields, may be filled in. Unless you hear otherwise from your network administrator or supervisor, there is generally no need to be particular about how you fill out the first two fields.</p>
        <p>If you wish to enter (or correct) the User Name, type your name when the dialog first appears, then type the <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> key to move on; if you do not want to enter (or correct) the User name, just type the <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> key.</p>
        <p>Now, if you wish to enter (or correct) the Organization, type your company name and <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> to move on. If you do not want to enter (or correct) the Organization, then just type <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span>. This datum is very often left blank.</p>
        <p>At this point, you'll have reached the critical part of the dialog. Into this third field, you must enter your License Text. If you are updating to <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" /> from an earlier installation, then your License Text will usually be displayed already. If this is a new installation, then you should find your License Text, in both print and braille, on card stock in the original shipping carton. Be sure to enter the License Text exactly as it appears on the card, paying attention to spaces and capital letters.</p>
        <p>License Text will usually look something like one of the following samples:</p>
        <p class="CourierPara">DBT H1234-12345678</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p class="CourierPara">Single-user license G1234-12345678 </p>
        <p>If you have any difficulty locating your License Text, then please contact your dealer or <a href="../new_users_start_here/GETTING_HELP.htm">Duxbury Systems</a>.</p>
        <p>Leave the License Text field blank if you are installing a demonstration version of DBT. You'll be given the chance to supply your license text after DBT is installed and running, should you decide that you wish to purchase a license.</p>
        <p>When you have completed the license text, or decided to omit it, click the Next button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>, to continue.</p>
        <h5>Step 4: Select the "Typical" Setup Type</h5>
        <p>This step could not be simpler! You'll see a screen like this one</p>
        <p align="center" class="center">:<img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_12.1_setup_type.jpg" title="Setup Type dialog" alt="Setup Type dialog" style="width: 370px;height: 282px;" /></p>
        <p>Just click Next, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> to continue. Changing anything in this dialog before clicking Next would start you along toward a <a href="Custom_Installation.htm">Custom Installation</a>. We do not recommend that for most users.</p>
        <h5>Step 5: Confirm your Work</h5>
        <p>The next screen simply shows you the answers that you have chosen so far:</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_12.1_ready_to_install_the_program.jpg" title="Ready to Install dialog" alt="Ready to Install dialog" style="width: 374px;height: 283px;" />
        </p>
        <p>This is your chance to stop and review the information you have given to the installer so far. If you want to make a change to the information on any of the earlier screens, click the Back button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+B</span> to return to the previous screen. That screen, in turn, will have a Back button for you to press (or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+B</span>), and so forth through to the first screen of the installer. Once you have made any corrections, use the Next button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span>, within each dialog, until you have returned to this one.</p>
        <p>Usually, however, there is no point in using that Back button. Just click the Install button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+I</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>, to let the installer go about its work. As the installer proceeds, you'll see a screen like this:</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_12.1_installing_dbt.jpg" title="Installing progress display" alt="Installing progress display" style="width: 354px;height: 269px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Even now, you can cancel the installation, though this takes longer than it would have before, because cancelling now will leave the installer with some clean-up tasks (which it handles automatically) in order to leave your computer unmodified.</p>
        <p>The status bar will reset itself several times and progress again from the left to the right. This can be modestly frustrating, but it is perfectly normal for this kind of program installation.</p>
        <h5>Step 6: Finish the Installation</h5>
        <p>When the installer has finished installing DBT and configuring your system, you'll see one final screen, like this one:</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_12.1_completed.jpg" title="Installation Completed dialog" alt="Installation Completed dialog" style="width: 345px;height: 261px;" />
        </p>
        <p>It is often a good idea to check the "Launch <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />" button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+L</span>, before clicking Finish, or typing <span class="Keyboard">Alt+F</span><span class="Keyboard" style="font-weight: normal;"> or </span><span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>. Only "Finish" is truly required, but if you check the "Launch <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />" button first, then the Installer will start DBT for you. Not only will this allow you to quickly confirm that DBT is working, but you'll also be able to Activate DBT (under most circumstances) and install and configure embossers. If you are not the end user, and the end user does not have Administrative Rights on this machine, then you should perform these tasks before turning the computer over to the end user.</p>
