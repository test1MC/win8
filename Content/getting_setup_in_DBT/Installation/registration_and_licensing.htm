        <p class="hcp1">If you have arrived at this topic having clicked on <a href="../../Registration_and_Activation/activation_submit_registration.htm">Help: Registration</a>, it usually means that you are not connected to the Internet. (Or you might simply have selected the Topic from the Table of Contents on the left)</p>
        <p class="hcp1">For full details on the process are contained in <a href="registration_and_licensing.htm">Licensing, Registration and Activation</a>.</p>
        <p class="hcp1">We would strongly recommend you register your version of DBT at the earliest possible opportunity. Product support cannot be provided otherwise.</p>
        <p class="hcp1">If you are unable to connect to the Internet, you may access a printable Registration form here by clicking on the Registration Form link. You may then complete the form on screen and print it, or alternatively print and complete it by hand.</p>
        <p class="hcp1">You may then fax or mail the form to Duxbury, or your local dealer, or even telephone either, to obtain Activation details.</p>
        <p class="hcp1">You may however also register on the Internet at <a href="http://www2.duxburysystems.com/registration.asp">http://www2.duxburysystems.com/registration.asp</a> but bear in mind that you will need to know your serial number to complete the form as it is not picked up from DBT.</p>
