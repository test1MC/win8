            <MadCap:keyword term="Custom:Installation;Installation:Custom" />Custom Installation</h3>
        <p>Before reading this topic, be sure that you have read and understood the instructions for <a href="Simple_Installation.htm">Simple Installation</a>. That topic includes full instructions for the simplest (and most common) type of DBT installation. This topic, in contrast, does not give full instructions for a more complex installation, but simply explains how to modify the Simple Installation steps to customize your installation.</p>
        <p>There are three different ways to modify the Simple Installation instructions covered here. You can easily elect to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="#1">Install all features</a>,</li>
            <li><a href="#2">Change where the software is installed</a>,</li>
            <li><a href="#3">Change where DBT's activation is stored</a>, or</li>
            <li><a href="#4">Customize what features are installed</a>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each of these customizations is covered in a separate section below.</p>
        <h5><a name="1"></a>Customization 1: Install all features</h5>
        <p>If this is all you want to do, the first thing to do is reconsider. The <a href="Simple_Installation.htm">Simple Installation</a> procedure in fact installs all or nearly all features anyhow. The only features you're likely to miss this way are the French Braille Fonts, which are not generally of interest outside of French-speaking nations.</p>
        <p>However, if you want to be absolutely certain that everything is installed, then simply click Complete, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+C</span>, when you see this screen (in step 4 of the Simple Installation instructions):</p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_11.3_setup_type.jpg" alt="Image shows Installer Wizard with Radio Buttoms to select Typical, Complete or Custom installation" style="width: 504px; height: 386px;" width="504" height="386" border="0" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 10.00cm;max-height: 7.63cm; }" />
        </p>
        <p>The remainder of the installation proceeds just as it does in the Simple Installation instructions.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you want to install all features <i>and</i> change the installation or activation storage directory, then you must instead follow the steps below for Customization 4: Customize what features are installed, then simply elect to install each and every feature. This is necessary because you can modify the installation directories only if you select Custom in the dialog shown above.</p>
        <h5><a name="2"></a>Customization 2: Change where the software is installed</h5>
        <p>Most of the files that the installer puts on your system are placed into a single folder, typically C:\Program Files\Duxbury Systems, Inc.\<MadCap:variable name="Primary.VersionFolder" />, for 32-bit computers. (On 64-bit machines, the typical folder is, C:\Program Files (x86)\Duxbury Systems, Inc.\<MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />. ) If the default location for this folder does not suit you, you can change it.</p>
        <p>First, when you see the dialog shown above (in step 4 of the <a href="Simple_Installation.htm">Simple Installation</a> instructions), you must click Custom, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+S</span>, before clicking Next, or typing <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>. By doing this, you cause the installer to insert two extra dialogs in the installation sequence.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you do not alter any of the settings in either of these two installation dialogs, then the result is exactly the same as if you had followed the Simple Installation instructions without elaboration. That is, the result is a "Typical" installation.</p>
        <p>The first extra dialog, which allows you to change where the software is installed, is shown here:</p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_11.3_Destination_Folder.JPG" alt="Image shows the installer's Destination Folder dialog. Two folder locations are shown as non-editable text. The first folder location is labelled Install DBT 10.6 to:&quot;. The second folder location is labelled &quot;Track DBT 10.6 activation in:&quot;. There is a button labelled &quot;Change&quot; next to each folder location. There are three buttons, labelled Back, Next, and Cancel, at the bottom of the dialog." style="width: 504px; height: 386px;" width="504" height="386" border="0" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 10cm;max-height: 7.63cm; }" />
        </p>
        <p>If you want to change where the software is installed, click on the first Change button, or type the <span class="Keyboard">Tab</span> key until you reach it, then strike the <span class="Keyboard">Spacebar</span>. You will then see a dialog like this one:</p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_11.3_Change_Destination_Folder.JPG" alt="Image shows a dialog prompting to Change Current Destination Folder. There is a drop-down list showing the currently selected destination folder, toolbuttons to navigate to the parent directory or create a new subdirectory, an empty list showing the current contents of the destination folder, an editable text field showing the full path to the current destination folder, and OK and Cancel buttons." style="width: 504px; height: 386px;" width="504" height="386" border="0" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 10.00cm;max-height: 7.63cm; }" />
        </p>
        <p>If you wish, you can use the drop-down list at the top of the dialog to review the name of the current destination folder, and see the hierarchy of folders in which it will be created. (<b>Note:</b> the radiating lines shown in the folder icon to the left of "<MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />" in the image shown above indicate that this will be a new folder.)</p>
        <p>You can also use the Parent Folder and Create New Folder tool buttons that appear to the right of the drop-down list.</p>
        <p>However, it may be simplest just to use the editable text control near the bottom of the dialog. This shows, as plain text, the full path to the folder proposed as a destination for <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />. In our example above, this control contains the text "c:\Program Files (x86)\Duxbury\<MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" />". This text is also highlighted in the example shown above, which indicates that it is selected. This is the way the dialog first appears. So be careful when the dialog first appears, because any text that you type will replace the entire proposed destination path. We recommend using an arrow key, or perhaps the <span class="Keyboard">Home</span> key, if you just want to change the drive letter, before you start editing the text of this control. (Note: If you make a mistake, just press <span class="Keyboard">Escape</span>, or click the Cancel button, then push <span class="Keyboard">Spacebar</span> again, or re-click the Change button in the Destination Folder dialog, to return to this dialog.)</p>
        <p>The path that you specify does not need to exist. The installer will create the destination folder for you, as well as any parent folders as required. However, you do need to have sufficient operating privileges on this computer in order to create these folders.</p>
        <p>When you have finished modifying the destination folder, click the OK button or type <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>. You will be returned to the Destination Folder dialog, which will now be updated to reflect the new Destination Folder you specified. Click Next, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span>, to continue. Or, if you wish to change the folder for DBT's Activation files, then read the next section.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> While the Change Destination Folder dialog remains active, the Installer periodically checks to be sure that you're specifying a valid location — either an existing folder to which you can write files, or a path that you can create. It also checks this when you click OK to dismiss the dialog. If the path is not valid, the installer might pop up an error message like this one:</p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_11.3_error.jpg" alt="Image shows a dialog with the text: &quot;Error 1303: The installer has insufficient privileges to acess this directory: D:\Program Files. The installation cannot continue. Log on as an administrator or contact your system administrator.&quot; A button labelled OK appears at the bottom of the dialog." border="0" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 10.00cm;max-height: 7.63cm; }" />
        </p>
        <p>You can dismiss any such error message easily enough by clicking OK or pressing <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span>. The Installer may or may not then immediately "fix" your mistake by resetting the text of the Folder Name to be what it was when the dialog first appeared. Watch out for that.</p>
        <h5><a name="3"></a>Customization 3: Change where DBT's Activation is stored</h5>
        <p>In order to become activated, DBT needs to store several activation files on your hard drive. These files are stored separately from your DBT software because, unlike the program files which are normally in a read-only directory, the activation files must be placed in a folder that is writable by any person running DBT. DBT normally places the activation folder at C:\Sheriff.</p>
        <p>If you need to change the location of the Activation files, follow the procedures as outlined above for changing where the software is installed, but use the second Change button in the Destination Folder dialog instead of the first. Be sure that you specify a location that your end users can read and write.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you make this change while updating or modifying a previous <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Short_DBT" /> installation, then the installer might need to deactivate DBT before relocating the activation files. It will do this automatically; but this will leave your software deactivated, so you'll have to activate it again when you next run DBT.</p>
        <h5><a name="4"></a>Customization 4: Customize what features are installed</h5>
        <p>When you select a Custom installation, the Destination Folder dialog required to change the location where DBT itself or its activation files are stored is but the first of two dialogs that the installer inserts into the normal sequence. The second of these two dialogs is used to choose specific features to be installed. It looks like this:</p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_11.3_Feature_Selection_Menu.JPG" alt="Image shows a Feature Selection dialog. There is a tree control on the left, listing features, an informatoinal panel on the right, describing the feature selected in the tree control, and buttons along the bottom labelled Help, Space, Back, Next, and Cancel." style="width: 504px; height: 386px;" width="504" height="386" border="0" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 10.00cm;max-height: 7.63cm; }" />
        </p>
        <p>The most important part of this dialog is the tree control, on the left side of the dialog. This is used to show which features are currently selected for installation, and can be used to select or de-select features for installation.</p>
        <p>The tree control shows only the name of each feature. Unfortunately that may not always tell you enough about it to know whether you want it installed. For certain select items in the tree control, additional information is displayed in the "Feature Description" portion of the dialog, to the right of the tree control. For these items (like Sheriff Tools), you can read this information to learn more. Note that you can not de-select the basic features of DBT, so you can not create an installation that will not work.</p>
        <p>The following keys can be used within the tree control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Keyboard">Up Arrow</span> moves the selection to the previous item in the tree control, scrolling the control if necessary. <span class="Keyboard">Up Arrow</span> does nothing if the first item in the control is already selected.</li>
            <li><span class="Keyboard">Down Arrow</span> moves the selection to the next item in the tree control, scrolling the control if necessary. <span class="Keyboard">Down Arrow</span> does nothing if the last item in the control is already selected.</li>
            <li><span class="Keyboard">Right Arrow</span> moves the selection to the first individual item or subgroup within a feature group, expanding the tree control to show the contents of the feature group if necessary. <span class="Keyboard">Right Arrow</span> does nothing when it is on an individual feature.</li>
            <li><span class="Keyboard">Left Arrow</span> moves the selection from an individual feature to the feature group that contains it. When a feature group is selected, <span class="Keyboard">Left Arrow</span> hides the features within it, or does nothing if they are already hidden.</li>
            <li><span class="Keyboard">Spacebar</span> brings up a popup menu, which is discussed in more detail below.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the Feature Selection dialog is first displayed, all feature groups are expanded, so all individual features are showing. Moreover, most or all features are selected for installation.</p>
        <p>To de-select a particular feature, navigate to it within the tree control, using the keystrokes shown above, or by clicking on the feature with the mouse. Now push <span class="Keyboard">Spacebar</span> or right click on the feature with the mouse. A menu will pop up, as shown here:</p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/DBT_11.3_Feature_Selection.JPG" alt="Image shows a dialog, as above, with a pop-up menu displayed over a portion of the dialog." style="width: 507px; height: 388px;" width="507" height="388" border="0" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 10cm;max-height: 7.63cm; }" />
        </p>
        <p>The pop-up menu contains these choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><u>This feature will be installed on local hard drive</u>. This choice is the default for most individual features. It simply means that files related to this feature will be installed. However, if this is a feature group, rather than an individual feature, then selecting this will not automatically imply that individual features within this group will also be installed.</li>
            <li><u>This feature, and all subfeatures, will be installed on local hard drive</u>. This choice is available only for feature groups. Selecting it means that all files associated with the feature group and all individual features within the group, will be installed.</li>
            <li><u>This feature will be installed to run from network</u>. This choice is <b>not supported</b> by DBT. So please <b>do not select it</b>.</li>
            <li><u>This feature, and all subfeatures, will be installed to run from the network</u>. This choice is available only for feature groups, not for individual features. As with the previous choice, it is <b>not supported</b> by DBT. So please <b>do not select it</b>.</li>
            <li><u>This feature will not be available</u>. Select this choice if you do not want to install an individual feature. When you select this for a feature group, no feature within the group will be installed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you bring up the pop-up menu for a feature and decide that you do not want to change whether it is to be installed, you can dismiss the menu by striking the <span class="Keyboard">Escape</span> key. Either <span class="Keyboard">Escape</span> or <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> will dismiss the menu; <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> may change whether the feature is to be installed.</p>
        <p>You can continue navigating through the tree control, observing the Feature Description, and using the pop-up menu to change whether a feature is to be installed, until you are satisfied that you have selected just the right combination of features. When you're done, click the Next button, or type <span class="Keyboard">Alt+N</span>, to continue.</p>
        <p>The other buttons at the bottom of the dialog are typically not necessary to use. The Back and Cancel buttons serve their usual functions. The Help and Space buttons both bring up informational dialogs. The Help dialog explains what the different choices in the pop-up menu mean, and what the icon associated with each choice looks like. But it will not tell you that setting a feature to run from the network is not supported by DBT. The Space dialog lists the hard drives you have and how much space is available on each. It will highlight any hard drive that does not have enough space to install DBT. So if you're tight on space, you can use that dialog to explore where there might be room for DBT. Note also that de-selecting features for installation will reduce the space needed for the installation.</p>
