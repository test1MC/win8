        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <h3><a name="kanchor53"></a>Simple Installation</h3>
        <p>Chances are that you can get Perky Duck installed with only the instructions
included in this topic, or, for that matter without any instructions at all.
Installation of Perky Duck should usually be as simple as clicking on the
download link and following the prompts. But this guide is included to help you
as necessary along the way.</p>
        <h4>Step 1: Click on the Download Link</h4>
        <p>To get things started, click on the download link and choose Run. After a
moment you should see the installer Welcome Screen. </p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/simple-install1_perky.jpg" alt="Image of Perky's Installation Splash Screen" />
        </p>
        <p>Simply click the Next
button, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>,
to continue. If you wish to quit now, or when viewing any subsequent screen,
click the Cancel button, or type <span class="keyboard">Escape</span>. Your
system will not be changed regardless of when you choose to cancel the
installation..</p>
        <h4>Step 2: Read the License Agreement</h4>
        <p>Next, you will see the license agreement screen.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/simple-install2_perky.jpg" alt="Simple Install: Read the License Agreement" />
        </p>
        <p>Notice that the Next button is initially disabled. In order to continue
installation, you must accept the terms of the license agreement by selecting
the radio button so labelled, or by typing <span class="keyboard">Alt+A</span>. <i>If
this is your first time installing Perky Duck we urge you to read the text
first.</i> If you choose not to accept the agreement, you may cancel installation.</p>
        <p>If you accept the license agreement, simply click Next, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>, to continue.</p>
        <h4>Step 3: Personalize your Installation</h4>
        <p>The next screen is where you personalize your installation if you wish to.</p>
        <p>Some parts of the dialog, the User Name, Organization, and License Text
fields, may be filled in. Unless you hear otherwise from your network
administrator or supervisor, there is generally no need to be particular about
how you fill out the first two fields.</p>
        <p>If you wish to enter (or correct) the User Name, type your name when the
dialog first appears, then type the <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> key to move
on; if you don't want to enter (or correct) the User name, just type the <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> key.</p>
        <p>Now, if you wish to enter (or correct) the Organization, type your company
name and <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> to move on. If you don't want to enter
(or correct) the Organization, then just type <span class="keyboard">Tab</span>.
This datum is very often left blank.</p>
        <h4>Step 4: Select the "Typical" Setup Type</h4>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/simple-install3_perky.jpg" alt="Simple Install: Setup Type" />
        </p>
        <p>This step couldn't be simpler! You'll see a screen with three options. Just leave
Typical selected and click Next, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="keyboard">Enter</span> to continue. Changing anything in this dialog
before clicking Next would start you along toward a Custom Installation. 
We don't recommend that for most users.</p>
        <h4>Step 5: Confirm your Work</h4>
        <p>The next screen simply shows you the answers that you've chosen so far.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/simple-install4_perky.jpg" alt="Simple Install: Confirm Your Work" />
        </p>
        <p>This is your chance to stop and review the information you've given to the installer
so far. If you want to make a change to the information on any of the earlier
screens, click the Back button, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+B</span> to
return to the previous screen. That screen, in turn, will have a Back button
for you to press (or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+B</span>), and so forth
through to the first screen of the installer. Once you've made any corrections,
use the Next button, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+N</span>, within each
dialog, until you've returned to this one.</p>
        <p>Usually, however, there's no point in using that Back button. Just click the
Install button, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+I</span> or <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>, to let the installer go about it's work. As the
installer proceeds, you'll see a screen with a status bar.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/simple-install5_perky.png" alt="Simple Install: Copying Files" />
        </p>
        <p>Even now, you can cancel the installation, though this takes longer than it
would have before, because cancelling now will leave the installer with some
cleanup tasks (which it handles automatically) in order to leave your computer
unmodified.</p>
        <p>The status bar will reset itself several times and progress again from the
left to the right. This can be modestly frustrating, but it is perfectly normal
for this kind of program installation.</p>
        <h4>Step 6: Finish the Installation</h4>
        <p>When the installer has finished installing Perky Duck and configuring your
system, you'll see one final screen.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/simple-install6_perky.jpg" alt="Simple Install: Finished" />
        </p>
        <p>It is often a good idea to check the "Launch<span class="primaryproductshort"> Perky Duck</span>" button, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+L, before clicking Finish, or typing Alt+F or Enter. Only
"Finish" is truly required, but if you check the "Launch </span><span class="primaryproductshort">Perky Duck</span><span class="keyboard">" button
first, then the Installer with start Perky Duck for you. Not only will this
allow you to quickly confirm that Perky Duck is working, but you'll also be
able to install and configure embossers. If you aren't the end user, and the
end user </span>doesn't have Administrative Rights on this machine, then you
should perform these tasks before turning the computer over to the end user.</p>
        <h3>Custom Installation</h3>
        <p>Before reading this topic, be sure that you've read and understood the
instructions for <a href="Installation.htm">Simple
Installation</a>. That topic includes full instructions for the simplest (and
most common) type of Perky Duck installation. This topic, in contrast, doesn't
give full instructions for a more complex installation, but simply explains how
to modify the Simple Installation steps to customize your installation.</p>
        <p>You may use Custom Installation to change where Perky is installed.</p>
        <p>Most of the files that the installer puts on your system are placed into a
single folder, typically C:\Program&#160;Files\Duxbury\<span class="primaryproductshort">Perky Duck 11.2</span>. If the default location for
this folder doesn't suit you, you can change it.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/installation/simple-install3_perky.jpg" alt="Simple Install: Setup Type" />
        </p>
        <p>First, when you see the dialog shown above (in step 4 of the <a href="Installation.htm">Simple
Installation</a> instructions), you must click Custom, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+S</span>, before clicking Next, or typing <span class="keyboard">Alt+N</span> or <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>. By doing
this, you cause the installer to insert two extra dialogs in the installation
sequence.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you don't alter any of the settings in either of these two
installation dialogs, then the result is exactly the same as if you'd followed
the Simple Installation instructions without elaboration. That is, the result
is a "Typical" installation.</p>
        <p>The first extra dialog allows you to change where the software is installed.</p>
        <p>If you want to change where the software is installed, click on the first
Change button, or type the <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> key until you reach
it, then strike the <span class="keyboard">Spacebar</span>. You will then see a
dialog.</p>
        <p>If you wish, you can use the drop-down list at the top of the dialog to
review the name of the current destination folder, and see the hierarchy of
folders in which it will be created. (<b>Note:</b> the radiating lines shown in
the folder icon to the left of "Perky Duck" in the dialog indicate
that this will be a new folder.)</p>
        <p>You can also use the Parent Folder and Create New Folder tool buttons that
appear to the right of the drop-down list.</p>
        <p>However, it may be simplest just to use the editable text control near the
bottom of the dialog. This shows, as plain text, the full path to the folder
proposed as a destination for <span class="primaryproductshort">Perky Duck 11.2</span>.
In our example above, this control contains the text
"c:\Program&#160;Files\Duxbury\Perky Duck 11.2. This text is also
highlighted in the example shown above, which indicates that it is selected.
This is the way the dialog first appears. So be careful when the dialog first
appears, because any text that you type will replace the entire proposed
destination path. We recommend using an arrow key, or perhaps the <span class="keyboard">Home</span> key, if you just want to change the drive letter,
before you start editing the text of this control. &#160;(Note: If you make a
mistake, just press <span class="keyboard">Escape</span>, or click the Cancel
button, then push <span class="keyboard">Spacebar</span> again, or re-click the
Change button in the Destination Folder dialog, to return to this dialog.)</p>
        <p>The path that you specify does not need to exist. The installer will create
the destination folder for you, as well as any parent folders as required.
However, you do need to have sufficient operating privileges on this computer
in order to create these folders.</p>
        <p>When you have finished modifying the destination folder, click the OK button
or type <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>. You will be returned to the
Destination Folder dialog, which will now be updated to reflect the new
Destination Folder you specified. Click Next, or type <span class="keyboard">Alt+N</span>,
to continue</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> While the Change Destination Folder dialog remains active, the
Installer periodically checks to be sure that you're specifying a valid
location — either an existing folder to which you can write files, or a path
that you can create. It also checks this when you click OK to dismiss the
dialog. If the path isn't valid, the installer might pop up an error message. </p>
        <p>You can dismiss any such error message easily enough by clicking OK or
pressing <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>. The Installer may or may not then
immediately "fix" your mistake by resetting the text of the Folder
Name to be what it was when the dialog first appeared. Watch out for that.</p>
