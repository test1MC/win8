            <MadCap:keyword term="First Document" />First Document</h4>
        <h5>How to Start A New Document From Scratch</h5>
        <p>1. Select "File: New" from the menu</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version"> Or: use the shortcut command Ctrl + n by typing the key marked "Ctrl" and the letter "n" at the same time.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mac_Version">Or: use the shortcut command Command + n by typing the key marked "Command" and the letter "n" at the same time.</p>
        <p>2. Select "Print" and your preferred default template in the dialog box</p>
        <p>3. Click "OK"</p>
        <p>Observe:</p>
        <p>Shortcut Keys (in the pull-down menus)</p>
        <p>Shortcut key commands are listed next to the corresponding menu command. For instance, whenever you would select "File: New" from the menu, you can instead key in the shortcut without even opening the menu. Shortcut key options are an easy, quick way to carry out commands which can take much longer if you use the menu.</p>
        <h5>How to Enter New Text</h5>
        <p>To create our first document, we are going to type a letter. Type the following, using Enter twice at every skipped line. Do NOT press Enter where lines end within the paragraph; just use the Space bar as you normally would between words, and let DBT "wrap" the lines automatically:</p>
        <p class="CourierPara"><span class="Code-DuxScreen">Dear Mother,</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CourierPara"><span class="Code-DuxScreen">How are you? I am well. I am learning how to use the Duxbury Braille Translator. It is not very hard! All you have to do is to type in the text, tell the program to translate, and emboss!</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CourierPara"><span class="Code-DuxScreen">Love,</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CourierPara"><span class="Code-DuxScreen">Misty.</span>
        </p>
        <p>That is all - it is that simple! (Later on, we will see that proper formatting of most kinds of documents requires more than just pressing Enter twice for skipped lines -- but in this case, that is all that is needed.)</p>
        <h5>How to Translate A Document</h5>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">Select "File: Translate" from the menu or type <span class="Keyboard">Ctrl + t</span>.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Mac_Version">Select "File: Translate" from the menu or type <span class="Keyboard">Command + t</span>.</p>
        <p>That is all! You have translated your document!</p>
        <h5>How to Emboss A Document</h5>
        <p>Embossing a document is very easy. It is setting up the embosser that can be difficult. That subject is covered in the section "Installation and Setup." Please be sure that the embosser setup has been completed before proceeding with this step -- or, if you do not have an embosser, skip this step.</p>
        <p>1. Select "File: Emboss." Or: type the shortcut keys. IMPORTANT: IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN EMBOSSER SET UP, DO NOT USE THE "EMBOSS" COMMAND!</p>
        <p>2. Click "OK" or type the Enter key</p>
        <h5>How to Close A Document</h5>
        <p>There are three ways to close a document. Be sure to close the document, not the application.</p>
        <h6>Take the Long Route - Use the File Menu</h6>
        <p>1. Select "File: Close" from the menu</p>
        <p>2. If DBT asks whether you want to save the document, click "No."</p>
        <h6>Take the Mouse Shortcut</h6>
        <p>1. Click the document's "Close" button</p>
        <p>2. If DBT asks whether you want to save the document, click "No."</p>
        <h6>Take the Keyboard Shortcut</h6>
        <p>1. Type <span class="Keyboard">Ctrl + F4</span></p>
        <p>2. If DBT asks whether you want to save the document, click "No."</p>
        <h5>How to Save A Document</h5>
        <p>1. Select "File: Save" from the menu, or type <span class="Keyboard">Ctrl + s</span>.</p>
        <p>2. Type "letter.dxp"- the extension ".dxp" tells DBT that this is going to be a DBT print document.</p>
        <p>3. Be sure to save your document in the "dbtdocs" directory.</p>
        <p>4. Click "Yes" or press the <span class="Keyboard">Enter</span> key.</p>
        <p>A Note About Closing and Saving Documents:</p>
        <p>When you exit DBT, the application first closes any open documents. If you have made changes to a document and have not saved those changes, DBT will ask you if you want to save your changes. DBT also saves the position of your cursor. If your document is a long one, you may find that the next time you open the document, you can not see the beginning of it. In order to avoid confusion, type <span class="Keyboard">Ctrl + Home</span>, to place your cursor at the beginning of the document, before saving. If you want to remember where you stopped working, then do not move the cursor to the beginning of the document before saving it.</p>
        <h5>How to Exit DBT Win</h5>
        <h6>Take the Long Route - Use the File Menu</h6>
        <p>Select "File: Exit" from the menu</p>
        <h6>Take the Mouse Shortcut</h6>
        <p>Click the application's "Close" button. <img src="../../Resources/Images/getting_setup_in_dbt/beginners_guide/xp_close_button.jpg" alt="image shows a typical Windows Close button" style="width: 25px; height: 25px;" width="25" height="25" border="0" /></p>
        <h6>Take the Keyboard Shortcut:</h6>
        <p>Type <span class="Keyboard">Alt + F4</span></p>
