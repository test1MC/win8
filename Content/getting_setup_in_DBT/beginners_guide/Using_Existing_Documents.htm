            <MadCap:keyword term="Editing;Document:Using Existing;editing:Existing;Existing" />Using Existing Documents</h4>
        <h5>How to Open an Existing Document</h5>
        <p>Now that we have already created a new document and closed DBT, we want to go back and make some changes.</p>
        <p>1. Open DBT again. Once you have done that, we will open the document</p>
        <p>2. Select "File: Open" from the menu; OR: Type Ctrl + o</p>
        <p>3. Select "letter.dxp". This is the file that you already created and saved.</p>
        <p>4. Click "Open." You can double-click the file that you want to open in lieu of clicking the "Open" button.</p>
        <h5>How To Make Changes To An Already Existing Print Document</h5>
        <p>Notice where the cursor is located. When you save a document, the position of your cursor is also saved. When you open that document, you can move the cursor one of two ways:</p>
        <p>· Using the mouse, click on the point in the text where you want the cursor to be.</p>
        <p>· Using keyboard arrows, move the cursor to the point on the text where you want the cursor to be.</p>
        <p>Now we will continue working with our letter.</p>
        <p>1. Insert the cursor in front of the question mark in the sentence "How are you?"</p>
        <p>2. Add the word "doing"</p>
        <p>3. The text should now say "How are you doing?"</p>
        <h5>Cut and Paste, Copy, Insert, Highlight</h5>
        <p>You can do all of these things just as you do in other word processing programs.</p>
        <p>To select text, use your mouse or use the shift key with arrows. (Incidentally, I find that using the keyboard instead of the mouse is much quicker and more accurate in DBT.)</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the words "I am learning how to use the Duxbury braille Translator. " You may select text by using your mouse, or by using your keyboard.</li>
            <li>To cut text, select "Edit: Cut" from the menu or type Ctrl + x. Cut the words you selected.</li>
            <li>To paste text, select "Edit: Paste" from the menu or type Ctrl + v. Move the cursor and paste the words "I am learning how to use the Duxbury Braille Translator. " before the words "How are you doing?"</li>
            <li>To copy text, select "Edit: Copy" from the menu or type Ctrl + c. Copy the words "I am well. "</li>
            <li>Paste the words "I am well. " before the words "I am learning how to use the Duxbury Braille Translator."</li>
            <li>Save your changes.</li>
            <li>Close the document.</li>
            <li>Close DBT.</li>
            <li>You have just made changes to your document, saved the changes and closed both the document and the application that created it.</li>
            <li>Open DBT</li>
            <li>Open the document "letter.dxp"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The text should now say,</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxScreen">Dear Mother,</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxScreen">I am well. I am learning how to use the Duxbury Braille Translator. How are you? I am well. It is not very hard! All you have to do is to type in the text, tell the program to translate, and emboss!</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxScreen">Love,</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxScreen">Misty.</span>
        </p>
        <h5>About Saving Documents: Save vs. Save As</h5>
        <p>There are two ways to save a document. You have already seen the save command, which saves any changes to the document that you have made. The Save As command does the same thing, but saves the changes as a new document.</p>
        <p>1. Delete the fourth sentence, "I am Well." from the document.</p>
        <p>2. Choose "File: Save As" from the menu or press the F3 key.</p>
        <p>3. Name the file "letterch.dxp"</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="DBTDOCS" />4. Save the document in the \dbtdocs folder</p>
        <p>5. Close the document</p>
        <p>6. Open letter.dxp</p>
        <p>As you can see, the changes made to "letter.dxp" have not been saved. This is because you selected "Save As" rather than "Save." "Save As" saves the changes you have made into an entirely new document.</p>
        <p>7. Close "letter.dxp"</p>
        <p>8. Open "letterch.dxp" and observe the changes.</p>
        <h5>How to Print A Document</h5>
        <p>The subject of setting up your printer is covered within the section entitled "Installation and Setup." Please be sure that the printer setup has been completed before proceeding with this step -- or, if you do not have a printer, skip this step.</p>
        <p>1. Type Ctrl + p or select "File: Print" from the menu. IMPORTANT: If you have not set up a printer, you will just get an error message.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Interline Print" />2. If you are printing the braille (dxb) document, there is a way of printing a translated line of print above each line of braille. In order to activate this feature, select "Interline Print" in the print dialog box.</p>
        <p>3. Set the number of copies and the print range</p>
        <p>4. Click "OK"</p>
        <h5>How to Edit an Existing Braille Document</h5>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="6-key" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="6-key:Chording" />It is possible to edit a braille document directly using 6-key chording. This means that six of the keys on your keyboard correspond with the six dots in a braille cell. In order to create a braille cell, press the keys which correspond with the dots in that cell simultaneously. Usually, the corresponding keys are:</p>
        <p>Dot 1 = f</p>
        <p>Dot 2 = d</p>
        <p>Dot 3 = s</p>
        <p>Dot 4 = j</p>
        <p>Dot 5 = k</p>
        <p>Dot 6 = l</p>
        <p>However, these corresponding keys vary from keyboard to keyboard, so trial and error may be required to determine the corresponding keys. In order to determine if your keyboard supports 6-key chording, open DBT and start a new braille document. Type all of the above keys at once. If you get a full cell, your keyboard probably supports 6-key chording.</p>
