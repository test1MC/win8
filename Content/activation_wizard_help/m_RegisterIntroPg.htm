        <p>Registration means supplying your contact information to Duxbury Systems, so that Duxbury support can associate you and your license number.</p>
        <p>That way, if an inquiry comes in about a license number, Duxbury Systems knows if the inquiry is coming from the registered owner (you!) or not.</p>
        <p>There are four ways to register:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet (recommended).</li>
            <li>Email (the Activation Wizard will construct that email for you).</li>
            <li>Telephone Call to Duxbury Systems.</li>
            <li>Fax or Postal Mail to Duxbury Systems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you telephone and record this information in a message at Duxbury Systems, please be very careful to include all the information on this form. Speak clearly, and include a phone number where you can be reached in case of a problem.</p>
