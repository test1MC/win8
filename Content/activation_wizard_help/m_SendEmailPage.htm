        <p>This screen is intended for sending an email to the Duxbury Systems staff. If you do not press the <b>Send</b> button, no email is sent.</p>
        <p>To send an email directly from the Activation Wizard, your computer must have Internet access, and it must have a default email program (such as Windows Outlook) installed.</p>
        <p>If you use a web-browser email program, you can copy information from the wizard into your web-browser email and send it from there. You can use the Send Fax option to collect the information you need, and then copy it from the text editor file that Send Fax creates.</p>
        <p>Please, give the Duxbury staff enough time to respond to this email.</p>
