            <MadCap:keyword term="User:Activation pending" />Welcome, User with Activation Pending</h2>
        <p>Normally you receive this Welcome because you started activating your Duxbury program through a method that requires two steps. In the first step, you sent the information for activating your computer to Duxbury Systems.</p>
        <p>Now it is time to complete the second step. This requires that you have the reply from Duxbury Systems, whether by email, fax, mail, or phone. So now, you want to enter this information to activate your Duxbury product.</p>
        <p>You may also see this Welcome if you attempted an activation that reported back an error message instead of continuing to completion. If so, or if you do not understand how you got here, you can safely start over.</p>
