        <h4 class="normal">Activation with or without the Internet</h4>
        <p>Automatic activation over the Internet is quick and easy. By comparison manual activation is more difficult, as it requires two separate steps and more time. If you have access to the Internet from your machine, Internet activation is recommended. However, if your computer has no access to the Internet, you have three options for how to proceed. (See "Options without the Internet".)</p>
        <p>If your computer is not already connected to the Internet, for example, if you need to start up a dial-up connection, or turn on a wireless router, now is the time to do so.</p>
