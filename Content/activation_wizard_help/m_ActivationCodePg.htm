        <h4 class="normal">Activation Code (Manual Activation)</h4>
        <p>In a manual activation, you enter the information you receive from Duxbury on this page. You receive three pieces of information to activate your program. Depending on the choice you made, this information may arrive by email, phone, fax, or postal mail. </p>
        <p>You receive two numeric codes and a version number. Do not try to "fix it" if the version number you see is higher than the version of your program. The version number you receive (or that is pre-filled) indicates that you can activate any version of your program up to that one. Please, enter the version number as you received it. (And if you are interested in the later version, by all means, use "Check for Updates" from the program Help menu to get more information!)</p>
        <p>The long code is a string of 40 digits in groups of four. This is your activation code. The short code is your confirmation number. It insures that all three pieces of information are entered correctly. That is, it helps to prevent accidentally entering a wrong digit when you put the activation code in.</p>
        <p>Again, be sure to enter the codes and version number exactly as given to you. It can be handy to use cut and paste when the information is sent to you by email. </p>
