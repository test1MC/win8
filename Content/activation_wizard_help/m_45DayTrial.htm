        <h2>To Start a 45-Day Trial (DBT)</h2>
        <p>This feature applies to the Duxbury Braille Translator only. It is for users with a valid DBT license, perhaps purchased with an earlier version of the translator.</p>
        <p>"License for 45-Day Trial" lets you enter your Duxbury license. It then begins a 45-day period during which DBT will run in normal production mode without activation. At the end of that period you must activate your DBT for it to continue running.</p>
        <p>If you entered your license during installation as most people do, there is no need to re-enter it here. The 45-day trial period does not restart.</p>
