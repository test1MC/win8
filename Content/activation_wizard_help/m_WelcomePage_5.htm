        <h2>Welcome, User Activated as a Client</h2>
        <p>After you have activated as a client of another computer on your network, this Welcome screen displays the current status of your activation.</p>
        <p>The key information is whether your network server is responding to requests (normal) or not answering (error). If the Welcome screen says, "Your program is activated by connection to a shared activation server, but that server is not responding," then your program will not run in production mode until you fix the problem.</p>
        <p>Your license host computer may need to be restarted, or possibly only the slsService running on that computer may need to be restarted. If you are not familiar with computer services, you should get help from your LAN administrator or IT Support person.</p>
        <p>If the screen says, "Currently your program is activated by connection to a shared activation server on your LAN," then your program is activated normally. You can also use the Activation Wizard to collect diagnostic information or to perform other tasks. You can do any of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Diagnosis of activation problems. </li>
            <li>Registration -- telling us who you are.</li>
            <li>Disconnection from the current shared activation computer (network license host) and connection to a new one.</li>
        </ul>
