        <p>Your Duxbury product is licensed but is not activated. This means you have received your Duxbury product license number but have not started the Activation process.</p>
        <p>You need to select one of the options for activation from the Main page. If you are a single user, select "Activate this computer".</p>
        <p>If you are one of several users in a multi-user network, you probably need to select the "Connect" task. Check this with your IT Support people.</p>
        <p>If you are the person setting up this computer to be the license server for your network, you need to select "Set up this server to host the network license". </p>
