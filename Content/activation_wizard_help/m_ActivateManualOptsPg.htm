        <h4 class="normal">Activation Options without the Internet</h4>
        <p>If you must activate without the Internet, you need to communicate with Duxbury Systems a different way. You have these choices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email (the easiest choice for you)</li>
            <li>Telephone call to Duxbury Systems</li>
            <li>Fax or Postal mail to Duxbury Systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For all of these, you use the wizard to collect information to send to Duxbury Systems. In return, Duxbury sends back a code which you submit to the Activation Wizard. </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version"><b>NOTE on 2-Step Activation</b>: The second step when you receive your reply from Duxbury Systems is to open the activation wizard again. On the Main page, the task "Activate this computer" may be pre-selected for you. If you are activating your program as a single user, you should select that option. However, if you are activating your program as a license server for multiple users, you must select the task, "<b>Set up this server to host the network license</b>" instead.</p>
        <p>Working by telephone is usually the most difficult option. If you record your activation request in a message at Duxbury Systems, please be very careful to include all the information on this form. Speak clearly, and include your contact information (a phone number, an email address, or a mailing address), so that Duxbury can complete the Activation.</p>
