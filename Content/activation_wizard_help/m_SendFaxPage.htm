        <p>Pressing the View/Print button opens a text file for you in a simple text editor. The key information for your request is already filled in for you. You will likely need to add more information to this, however, particularly contact information for a reply!</p>
        <p> You can print this page for faxing to Duxbury Systems. Please remember that small fonts do not fax very well, so do take the time to enlarge the font for the document before you print it out. We recommend using 12 or 14 point type.</p>
