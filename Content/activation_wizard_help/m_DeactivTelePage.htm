        <h4 class="normal">De-activation by Telephone</h4>
        <p>De-activating your Duxbury Program makes it stop running on this computer. Once you have de-activated, you can re-activate again later. Or you can then activate your program on a different computer.</p>
        <p>This page collects and displays the information you need to de-activate via the telephone. Normally you should speak with someone at Duxbury Systems who can step you through the process. If you cannot contact Duxbury Systems, you have the option to leave a message.</p>
        <p>Note, however, if you leave a message, please be very careful to include <b>all the information</b> from this page. Speak clearly, and include your contact information: a phone number, an email address, or a mailing address, so that Duxbury Support can follow up as necessary to complete the de-activation for you.</p>
