        <h2>Why have some contractions been dropped?</h2>
        <p>With more and more computer technology being used, one of the aims of UEB was to remove as much of the ambiguity as possible such that back-translation became more accurate and reliable.</p>
        <p>Web and e-mail addresses are an obvious example, where periods or full stops appear unspaced, especially to the right of the period, such as in .com.</p>
        <p>Hence why "dis" and "dd" have been dropped.</p>
