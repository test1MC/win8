        <h2>What is different in UEB?</h2>
        <p>This is a question which cannot really be answered here.</p>
        <p>Essentially you will have to refer to your local Braille Authority.</p>
        <p>In the United Kingdom and/or where English (British) braille is used, you will find details of the changes and how it relates to this specific code at <a href="http://www.ukaaf.org/braille-downloads/braille-training-and-resources/ueb-summary">http://www.ukaaf.org</a></p>
