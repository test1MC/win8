        <h2>How do I get dot 5 for a space between numbers?</h2>
        <p>This is a tip which may also apply in many circumstances.</p>
        <p>A telephone number would be written as normal:</p>
        <p class="CourierPara">123 456 7890</p>
        <p>Prior to UEB, the result in braille would usually be:</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">#abc #def #ghij</p>
        <p>In UEB the same should translate to:</p>
        <p class="Simbraille">#abc"def"ghij</p>
        <p>In order to produce the Dot 5 character, you need to insert a "Hard Space" in your text file, also known as a "non-breaking space", before you translate.</p>
        <p>If you are working within DBT, this kind of space can be inserted with the keystroke Alt+F2</p>
        <p>In Word for Windows, the keystroke is Ctrl+Shift+Space</p>
        <p>You can also use this feature to prevent text breaking over 2 lines.</p>
