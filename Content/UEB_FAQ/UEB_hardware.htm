        <h2>Will I need to upgrade my braille embosser?</h2>
        <p>Not normally unless your embosser has built-in translation tables, and certainly not if you are using DBT</p>
        <p>Provided your embosser works with your current computer,and its operating system, you will not have to upgrade the firmware unless specifically advised by the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>However, if you are upgrading your computer to a later operating system, do contact the embosser manufacturer to ensure that there are drivers available.</p>
