        <h2>Do I need to show bold, underline, italics, etc.?</h2>
        <p>"Yes" and "No" is the answer here.</p>
        <p>However, in many documents features like this are often what we might call "eye candy", and simply there to make the document visually appealing.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, it is possible that they do have a purpose or meaning. For example text might say:</p>
        <p class="Italic">"Suggest an alternative adjective for words which are <u>underlined</u>".</p>
        <p>In this example, the italics are clearly decorative, but the braille reader will need to be able to identify underlined words.</p>
