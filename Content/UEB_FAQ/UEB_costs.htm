        <h2>What is it going to cost to change to UEB?</h2>
        <h6>Software:</h6>
        <p>You will certainly need to ensure that your software is up to date. If you are reading this, then you will likely have the latest version of DBT which is <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Version_Current_DBT" />.</p>
        <p>However, be aware that any older versions you have may not be as up to date - assuming they even have UEB tables.</p>
        <h6>Hardware:</h6>
        <p>The vast majority of braille embossers should not require any form of upgrading. However, please check with the manufacturer.</p>
