        <p>English is clearly a very common language world-wide.</p>
        <p>Between English using countries there are differences in spelling many words, such as, "labor" and "labour", "realize" and "realise". This will not change.</p>
        <p>Over the years, braille has tended to develop in individual English using countries, particularly the way contracted is written, regardless of spelling.</p>
        <p>However its use and context have also changed., For example we now have periods or full stops unspaced in things like e-mail and web addresses.</p>
        <p>Consequently if we were so say that our e-mail address ended in .com (dot com), the braille reader would read this as "discom". This is because in Standard English Braille (SEB) the braille sign (dots 256) means "dis" when used at the beginning of a word, "dd" when in the middle of a word, and a period or full stop when it appears at the end of a word.</p>
