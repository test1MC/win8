        <p class="bold">Term definition for: Form</p>
        <p>This line defines one size of paper that can be used with the embosser. The paper size is measured in tenths of an inch. For example, the definition:</p>
        <p class="CourierPara"> 10_n = "85 x 100" ; SinglePage ; 34 x 22 ; 32 x 22</p>
        <p> This one says internal name is 10_n. 8.5 by 10 inches in size (numbers are in tenths). Pages are as individual pages (not like Index 4x4 which are double sized) The maximum size for this paper form is 34 by 22. though 32 by 22 is recommended.</p>
        <p>Please note the use of quotes, equal sign, letter x, and semi-colon. Clipboarding is recommended to help avoid errors.</p>
