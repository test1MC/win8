        <p>The command StartLeftMargin=0 indicates that in the manual for this embosser. the first cell is position 0. Thus a "left margin of 2" means to shift the starting position 2 spaces to cell number 3 by transcriber notation. The command StartLeftMargin=1 indicates that in the manual for this embosser. the first cell is position 1. Thus a "left margin of 3" means to shift the starting position 2 spaces to cell number 3 by transcriber notation. Thu use of this command allows the software to offer prompts that follow the numbering system used by the embosser. This could be tricky if a user has to deal with two embossers that number their cells differently.</p>
