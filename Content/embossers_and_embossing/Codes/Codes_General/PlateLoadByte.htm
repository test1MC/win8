        <p class="bold">Term definition for: PlateLoadByte</p>
        <p>PlateLoadByte = n means Setting of PED-30 data switch 2 (unused for other devices) Note that. when this is set and output is directed to a serial port. Setting the Prompt for New Sheet setting will not display a prompt. But output will be suspended until the specified byte is received.</p>
        <p>If you have a serial cable that does not support carrying data back to the host. Then it may be necessary to remove the PlateLoadByte line from the PED-30 definition and rely on prompts displayed on the host to replace true handshaking.</p>
