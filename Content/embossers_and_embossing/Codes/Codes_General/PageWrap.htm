        <p class="bold">Term definition for: PageWrap</p>
        <p>If a page is full. do not send a form feed. just use a carriage return. In many ways. this is a dangerous command. The good news is that you are able to make maximum use of a braille page (use all possible lines on a page). The drawback is that the driving software needs to know the exact number of lines per page that can be produced. If you make an adjustment on your embosser that changes the number of lines on a page. that needs to be reflected in the emb.elt file. Unless you use factory defaults. you may have to manually update this file.</p>
