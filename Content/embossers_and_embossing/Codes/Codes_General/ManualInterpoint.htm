        <p class="bold">Term definition for: ManualInterpoint</p>
        <p>This embosser has a feature to do interpoint. as long as the user can take out the first pass. flip the pages over. and insert the job unside down for a second pass. This feature is intended for embossers like the Nippon Telesoft Gemini. where DBT needs to prompt the user to insert the paper again. Do not use it with the Tiger series. where the Tiger driver software prompts the user to re-insert the paper (and DBT does not need to know anything about the mechanics of how the interpoint is produced).</p>
