        </p>
        <p>The Moutbatten has both serial and parallel ports (it uses a straight through serial cable. the unit senses which port is being used). It has with some built-in editing capabilities. Purchasers should know that when you have a multi-purpose tool. you need to configure it to meet your needs.</p>
        <p>The Mountbatten works best at 40 characters per line and 25 lines per page. Theoretically. the unit can be configured for a larger page size. but this is not recommended.</p>
        <p>Be careful to insert the paper straight. If the paper is inserted crooked. it changes the internal margin settings.</p>
        <p>There are two ways of sending commands to the Mountbatten. You can enter sequences from the keyboard (starting with the command key and ending with the margin release key on the right side of the machine). or you can enclose the command in curly brackets and send it from another device. such as a computer. </p>
        <p>Using the default setting. the unit wants to reformat the text. To keep the text intact. issue the following commands: {fsh off} {flit off} {ww off} {save}</p>
