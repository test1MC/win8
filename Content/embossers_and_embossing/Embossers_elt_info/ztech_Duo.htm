        <p>Be careful: The VersaPoint Duo is very different from the single-sided VersaPoint origionally produced by TeleSensory. The VersaPoint Duo is just like a Juliet.</p>
        <p>One difference is the keypad. The VersaPoint Duo has a telephone style keypad instead of the Juliet calculator style keypad. If you see instructions for the Juliet to press <b>0.1E</b> use <b>0*1#</b> for the VersaPoint Duo.</p>
        <p>The top of form. form feed. off-line/on-line and the "View" buttons are all removed from the keypad and brought out on the VersaPoint Duo on the top and side away from the keypad. The on-line/off-line control is a rocker switch. The VersaPoint's Read key is the same as the View or 'V' key on other Enabling embossers.</p>
        <p>The VersaPoint Duo has two ways of resetting to factory defaults: like a Juliet (see the section on the Juliet) or like a VersaPoint. The VersaPoint style reset is done by holding down the Form Feed. Line Feed. and Top of Form keys while powering up the unit.</p>
