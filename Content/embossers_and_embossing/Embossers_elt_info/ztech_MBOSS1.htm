        </p>
        <p>The MBOSS-1 is a modified inkprint printer. The original printer has both a serial jack and a parallel jack. As modified. an MBOSS-1 is either a serial or a parallel machine. <i>This means that every MBOSS-1 has one working jack and one non-working jack</i>.</p>
        <p>Most units sold were serial units. If you do not know if your MBOSS-1 is serial or parallel. assume that it is serial. Please do not just plug in a parallel cable and call us for technical support asking why it is not working.</p>
        <p>If you actually do have the parallel model. we believe that the connection is straightforward (but we do not have the settings for the DIP switches).</p>
        <p>If have the serial model. use a straight through female-to-male cable with a null modem adapter to connect the MBOSS-1 to one of your serial ports. We recommend a null modem adapter that has wires 1 and 7 are straight through. swaps wires 2 and 3. swaps wires 4 and 5. and swaps wires 6 and 20.</p>
        <p>Set switch bank 40 to: open open open closed open closed closed open. Set switch bank 41 to: open open open closed closed open open open open open. For technical support on the MBOSS-1. contact <a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/">Freedom Scientific</a> at 727-803-8600.</p>
