        <h1>Technical Tips for this Embosser</h1>
        <p><a href="../Embossers/ports.htm">General Advice about Computer Ports: Serial. Parallel. USB. and Network</a>
        </p>
        <p>This embosser units has both a serial and a parallel port. We recommend the parallel connection. If you are using the serial connection. use the dial for the baud rate (default in this software is 9600 baud). Set the switches to OFF. OFF. OFF. OFF. OFF. OFF for 8 data bits. 1 stop bit. no parity. and no Xon/Xoff. Turn unit off and on when making changes to the switch settings.</p>
        <p>There is a knob to indicate the type of input. Set it for NABCC6 (North American Braille Computer Code. 6 dots). There is a switch for 30 or 32 character per line. Next there are four switches (select just one to the right) to select 20. 22. 24. and special lines per page. One and only one switch from this group should be on (right). If not. an error tone sounds when you try to emboss. The "special" switch is for interpoint. Use it only on the BPW-32 or BMP-320. The next switch. labeled HI and LO sets the printing speed. The bottom switch is for paper size. You get to choose between 8 inch and 10 inch paper length.</p>
        <p>The paper feeds into the back. Loosely insert the first piece of paper. Turn the unit on. The red light goes on. Below the on/off switch is the paper feed rocker switch. Depress the top side (closer to the on/off button) to feed the paper into the unit. The red light should go off. There is a push button for on line/off line. You need to push this button to send braille to the embosser.</p>
        <p>On this software. make sure that the characters per line and the lines per page settings are the same between the machine settings and the software preferences.
