        <h5>Setting Administrative Rights</h5>
        <p>Duxbury DBT needs to run the ViewPlus Tiger Embosser Driver with administrative rights, so that DBT can change the setting in the Driver between interpoint and single-sided embossing.</p>
        <p>Here are the steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.	Select Devices and Printers from the Control Panel.</li>
            <li>2.	Right click on the Tiger Embosser and select Printer Properties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/embossers_and_embossing/viewplus/viewplus_premier_properties.jpg" alt="image of Devices and Printers" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>3.	You get to the following screen. Select the Security tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/embossers_and_embossing/viewplus/viewplus_properties_dialog.jpg" alt="Viewplus properties dialig with Security tab in view" />
        </p>
        <p>For all users, we are allowing maximum access to the ViewPlus driver software. In particular, Manage this printer” must be checked for the user (or the user’s group, such as Administrators).</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/embossers_and_embossing/viewplus/viewplus_user_properties.jpg" title="image of ViewPlus Properties dialig with Security showing Print, Manage the printer and Manage Documents check boxes checked." alt="image of ViewPlus Properties dialig with Security showing Print, Manage the printer and Manage Documents check boxes checked." />
        </p>
        <p>We repeat with the Administrators group.</p>
        <p class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/embossers_and_embossing/viewplus/viewplus-admin_properties.jpg" title="Image of Properties but for the administrator group" alt="Image of Properties but for the administrator group" />
        </p>
        <p>If you have a different version of Windows, or a different selection of users, these screens will be slightly different. What does not change is the need to give access rights for the users to the ViewPlus software.</p>
        <p>If users can switch from interpoint to single sided output from DBT, then you have updated these security rights correctly.</p>
