        </p>
        <p>The "blue bar" Index embossers are old. and pre-date the Index Basic-D The Index Advanced does graphics. the Index Basic does not. The Index Basic has both a serial and a parallel port. For use with a PC. we recommend using the parallel connection. Just set the S/P switch to P (parallel). The Index Advanced only has a serial interface.</p>
        <p>The Index embossers have a series of rocker switches on the top. Make note of one which switches between "normal" and "reformat". Always have the unit set for "normal". It is a frequent problem to accidentally change the setting to "reformat" and then wonder why this software is producing bad format. Please check your unit before calling technical support.</p>
        <p>If you use a serial connection. use a straight through female-to-male cable with a null modem adapter to connect the Index to one of your serial ports. We recommend a null modem adapter that has wires 1 and 7 are straight through. swaps wires 2 and 3. swaps wires 4 and 5. and swaps wires 6 and 20.</p>
        <p>Set the Index for 9600 baud. 8 data bits. 1 stop bit. and hardware handshaking. To do this. set the DIP switches to: off on on on off off off on.</p>
        <p>The Index also has a set up disk. Use it to make sure it is set to <i>computer braille</i>.</p>
        <p>On most devices. turning the power off and on again sets the parameters back to the DIP switch settings. Not so on the Index. To force the Index to read the DIP switches. you must press the square <i>reset</i> button. Other parameters for the Index are established by sending escape sequences from your computer. To reset those parameters back to their default values. you must instead do a <i>system reset</i>. To do a system reset. first turn the Index off. Then hold the form feed and paper rocker switches away from you while you turn the power on. Only this full system reset clears away parameter changes established by escape sequences.</p>
