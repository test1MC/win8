        <p>If you have a wheel mouse, click anywhere in this topic, hold down the 
 Control key, and roll the mouse wheel backwards and forwards to increase 
 or decrease the font size to an acceptable level.</p>
        <p>If you do not have a wheel mouse, the text size can be adjusted via 
 the "Text Size" option in Internet Explorer's View menu.</p>
