        <h5>Pre-UEB Braille Formatted File Importer</h5>
        <p>DBT 11.3 has a feature designed to help you update older braille formatted files into UEB braille. Here is a hypothetical situation. You once created braille for a document. Now someone wants a copy of that in UEB braille. But you lost the DBT file (please, always save your DBT files), but you do have a braille formatted file. So the question becomes, "Would Duxbury please solve this problem caused by my losing the Duxbury file?" This new feature is designed to handle this situation. Remember: English language only, no math in the files you can process.</p>
        <h6>Instructions for Importing the Braille Formatted File for this Feature.</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Launch DBT</li>
            <li>Press Control-O to open a file. Select a braille formatted file (brf file).</li>
            <li>During the import process, there is a screen that asks the DBT Template and the Import Filter. Select as specified:<ul><li>Select the English (UEB) - BANA or the English (UEB) - UK formatting DBT Template</li><li>The default Import Filter is Formatted Braille. The Import Filter just below this is Formatted Pre-UEB to Print. Move the cursor down to select Formatted Pre-UEB to Print.</li></ul></li>
            <li>After file import, you will have an inkprint file (*.dxp) which has some errors (formatting and translation). Locate the errors and fix them.</li>
            <li>The translation table for your file is UEB braille. When you translate to braille, you should have well-formatted UEB braille.</li>
        </ul>
