        <h4>Use of the New Languages and Language Improvements</h4>
        <p>If you are familiar with producing braille in a particular language, then seeing the improvements can be as simple as re-translating a document again, to see if the braille is improved.</p>
        <p>If you are not familiar with producing braille in a particular language, then seeing the improvements can be more difficult. You may need a sample file for a language that you do not use.</p>
        <p>There is a <a href="http://www.duxburysystems.com/samples.htm" title="Requires an internet connection" alt="Requires an internet connection">link on the Duxbury web site</a> [Requires an internet connection] which helps someone test different braille translation tables, even if brand new to DBT, and do not know the language being tested.</p>
