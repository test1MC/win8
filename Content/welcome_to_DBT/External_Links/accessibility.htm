        <h4>Use of the Accessibility and/or JAWS Script File Improvements</h4>
        <p>As you install and run DBT 11.3 for the first time, you are asked if you want to install the English JAWS script files.</p>
        <p>Most of the accessibility improvements in this list happen automatically, and JAWS operates more smoothly than ever before.</p>
        <p>Some of these items require a refreshable braille device. The key point is that the JAWS script files are more coordinated with the JAWS support of refreshable braille devices so that the JAWS commands for moving up or down a line properly update your braille device.</p>
