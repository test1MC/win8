        <h4>Use of the Braille Embosser Improvements</h4>
        <p>Most of these items require the use of the mentioned embosser.</p>
        <p>To use Tactile View software, you must obtain the Tactile View software (like DBT, this costs money).</p>
        <p>Many embossers from Enabling have the feature called <b>ET Speaks</b>. In certain situations in prior versions, ET Speaks would verbalize unwanted material. Now DBT and ET Speaks are better co-ordinated, resulting in more appropriate output.</p>
