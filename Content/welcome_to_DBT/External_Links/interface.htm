        <h4>Checking Out the User Interface</h4>
        <h5 class="normal">The Translated Line</h5>
        <p>In the DBT Editor, when you are in a braille file (*.dxb) you can see one line at the bottom of the page showing the inkprint of the line that contains the cursor. If it is not present, press Control-F8. The improvements in DBT 11.3 include many to make sure the translated line is a good translation of the braille line.</p>
        <h5>Default Embosser Output</h5>
        <p>When you use the Global, Embosser Settings to set up a New Embosser, one of the prompts on the General Settings Panel is Output Options. The choices are Print, Port, or File. The choice Port refers to a serial or parallel port. Because serial and parallel ports are no longer in common use, the default setting is now Printer (i.e., a Windows printer). We expect this simple change in the default value to cut down in the number of tech support calls. See <a href="../../embossers_and_embossing/usb_and_embossers.htm">this page</a> for more help in setting up an embosser in DBT.</p>
        <h5 class="normal">The Hyperlink Import Choices</h5>
        <p>Go to the Global, Import Options Menu. The Hyperlink Import Choices are on the top of this screen. The prompts are fairly clear about the consequences of the different settings.</p>
        <h5 class="normal">Removing Spaces around Math Signs of Comparisons</h5>
        <p>Go to the Global, Import Options Menu. Find the checkbox labeled Removing Spaces around Math Signs of Comparisons. Do not check this box for the lower grades, but do check it for the upper grades. This is an issue for the United Kingdom. In the United States, Nemeth math is often used instead of UEB math, so this would not apply.</p>
        <h5 class="normal">Removing Spaces around Dashes</h5>
        <p>Go to the Global, Import Options Menu. Find the checkbox labeled Removing Spaces around Dashes. Do not change this unless you are in Australia. If you are, we presume you know which setting to use.</p>
        <h5 class="normal">Code Page Specification</h5>
        <p>When you Open a file in DBT (especially a textfile), there is a new prompt Code Page (Character Set) at the bottom of the file open choices. The choice of a Code Page is only important when importing a textfile. The ability to specify the Code Page is of importance to those in Central Europe. For most users, keep this at Windows 1250.</p>
