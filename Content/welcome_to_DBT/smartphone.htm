        <p>(All logos shown and products described are trademarked by their respective owners).</p>
        <p class="bold">Disclaimer:</p>
        <p class="bold">There are many ways to use a Smart Phone to Work with DBT. These notes just mention a few.</p>
        <p class="bold">Readers should be aware that "cloud computing" applications often change without warning, so these instructions may no longer work exactly as presented after such a change. Please use this page more as a source of inspiration than as an exact guide to functionality from any particular vendor.</p>
        <h5>From An Android Phone to Duxbury DBT</h5>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Logos_non_Duxbury/android.jpg" style="width: 69px; height: 81px;" title="Android Logo" alt="Android Logo" /> <img src="../Resources/Images/Logos_non_Duxbury/google_drive.jpg" style="width: 81px; height: 81px;" title="Google Drive Logo" alt="Google Drive Logo" /></p>
        <p>These instructions allow you to scan a small section of text with your Smart Phone camera, have it converted to text, and subsequently load the text into DBT for braille production. These instructions use the Adobe ExportPDF software, which costs $20 annually for a license to produce a limited number of pages in a year.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <b>Google Play</b> to load the <b>Google Drive</b> app. This is a free app.</li>
            <li>Download <b>Google Drive</b> for your Windows computer at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive" title="External Link to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive" alt="External Link to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive</a></li>
            <li>Use the same e-mail address and password for both installations, so the two accounts are linked.</li>
            <li>On the Smart Phone, open the <b>Google Drive</b> app. Press the plus sign. Choose <span class="Keyboard">Scan</span>. We suggest you work with a very simple document to gain experience with this application.</li>
            <li>Do not try to scan in landscape mode, always use portrait (i.e. do not hold the phone sideways).</li>
            <li>Click on the Check Mark when you like your image. This step creates a PDF in <b>Google Drive</b>.</li>
            <li>On your desktop or laptop computer, open <b>Google Drive</b> and it should sync with the Android.</li>
            <li>On your desktop or laptop, once you view your PDF, go to <span class="Keyboard">File</span>, then <span class="Keyboard">Save As</span>, and then <b>Word or Excel Online ...</b></li>
            <li>The first time you do this, you will be asked to pay Adobe $20 (plus tax) for their <b>ExportPDF</b> software.</li>
            <li>The software asks you where on your computer you want to save a Microsoft Word file. Use a directory for temporary files.</li>
            <li>Launch Duxbury DBT. Open the Microsoft Word file created in the previous step</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>From iPhone to Duxbury DBT</h5>

        <p>There are quite a few suitable OCR applications on the iPhone. We have had a lot of good experience with ABBYY Finereader on a Windows computer. The same company offers <a href="https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/support/finereader_touch/ios/sr/" title="External ink to https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/support/finereader_touch/ios/sr/" alt="External ink to https://www.abbyy.com/en-us/support/finereader_touch/ios/sr/">ABBYY FineReader Touch</a> for text recognition via an on-line OCR service on the iPhone.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.iphonejd.com/iphone_jd/2013/02/review-abbyy-finereader-touch.html" title="External Link to http://www.iphonejd.com/iphone_jd/2013/02/review-abbyy-finereader-touch.html" alt="External Link to http://www.iphonejd.com/iphone_jd/2013/02/review-abbyy-finereader-touch.html">Click here for a review</a>. The cost is about 5 cents per page scanned, in lumps of $5-$10, and it produces files in an editable format (i.e. Microsoft Word files).</p>

        <h5>From Duxbury DBT to Smart Phone</h5>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Logos_non_Duxbury/microsoft_word.jpg" title="Microsoft Word Logo" alt="Microsodt Word Logo" style="width: 93px; height: 80px;" /> <img src="../Resources/Images/Logos_non_Duxbury/adobe-logo.jpg" style="width: 69px; height: 80px;" title="Adobe Logo" alt="Adobe Logo" /></p>
        <p>Duxbury DBT can translate from braille-to-print, from a DBT .dxb file to a DBT .dxp file. You can then export a DBT .dxp file to an Adobe PDF file (using, for example, Microsoft Word). The PDF file can be sent to your Android, iPhone, Kindle, or other mobile device. Click here for the details.</p>
        <p>Once you have created the PDF, it is just a matter of using e-mail or a "cloud computing" application to share files from your non-mobile device to your mobile device. This can be Drop Box, Google Drive, or any other of the systems that exist to meet this need.</p>
