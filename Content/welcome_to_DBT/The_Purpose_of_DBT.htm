        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Translate" />As implied by the name "Duxbury Braille Translator," translation between print and braille is its primary function. DBT can translate into either grade 1 (uncontracted) or grade 2 (contracted) literary braille for many languages, and also into several different braille codes for mathematics and other technical notation. DBT can also translate from braille into the equivalent print for most languages and braille codes.</p>
        <p>DBT also provides for formatting of braille documents, along with translation of the text. This generally implies reworking the format to a certain extent, as braille format is not always similar to print format.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="Perkins Brailler" />
            <MadCap:keyword term="Moon:functions" />In support of these basic functions, DBT provides a word processor for both print and braille. If your keyboard allows for it, you can work with the braille material using six-key editing -- that is, using the keyboard in a manner analogous to a Perkins brailler. Using DBT, you may edit files before translation and also the results of translation, and may send the print text to a regular printer and the braille to an embosser.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="word-processors" />DBT can also import from many other word-processors and other kinds of files from various sources.</p>
        <p>DBT can also perform similar functions for Moon, a raised-line tactile system that can be used as an introduction to braille or as an alternate reading method in some limited circumstances.</p>
