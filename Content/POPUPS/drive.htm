        <p>The drive is the letter assigned to the disk on which you store your data. The most common drive letter is C, which is usually a <a href="hard_disk.htm" target="_popup">hard disk</a> built into the computer. Other drives might include A and B, which are normally reserved for floppy disks, D, often a CD-ROM, and possibly F-Z for network and USB drives.</p>
