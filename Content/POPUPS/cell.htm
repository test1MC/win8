        <p>The basic six-dot (or in rare codes, eight-dot) structure from which all braille characters are composed. A six-dot cell is two dots across and three dots down. There are sixty-four combinations possible, including an empty cell for the space. Each dot in a cell has its own number, as follows:</p>
        <p>1* *4</p>
        <p>2* *5</p>
        <p>3* *6</p>
        <p>The letter c, for example, is the top two dots, which can be verbally described as dots 1-4.</p>
