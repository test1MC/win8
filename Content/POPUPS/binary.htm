            <MadCap:keyword term="Binary" />Binary data is composed of only two states (0 and 1, as understood by the computer internally) and is not limited to text, in contrast with ASCII data (link to popup). DBT document files are binary, which allows them to be opened and saved quickly, but prevents them from being readily accessed by other programs without the help of a <a href="bridge.htm" target="_popup">bridge</a>.</p>
