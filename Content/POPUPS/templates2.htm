        <p>The use of the term “Templates” is largely the same for DBT as it is for some word processing programs, such as MS Word. The purpose of a DBT template is to contain all of the Document Settings, including style definitions. A template can, but typically does not, contain text.</p>
        <p>The major difference between a DBT template and an MS Word template is that changes made to a DBT template after a document is created from the template will <b><i>not</i></b> affect the document. Changes made to MS Word templates often do affect any documents that refer to the template.</p>
