        <p>The ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) is a Federal law which passed in 1990. The intent of the law is to increase the civil rights of disabled people. Among other things, the ADA requires that braille appear on permanent interior architectural signs. DBT and other Duxbury products are widely used in the production of such signs.</p>
