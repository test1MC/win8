        <p>A device is essentially anything you attach to your computer in order to enhance your productivity. Some common devices include a speech synthesizer, scanner, printer and embosser.</p>
        <p>Devices need to communicate correctly with your computer and to do so, many devices use special <a href="driver.htm" target="_popup">drivers</a> which load up when you turn on your computer. Device drivers reduce the amount of memory available for programs and sometimes cause conflicts. If you ever call for support, it may be helpful if you know what device drivers are loaded.</p>
