        <p><MadCap:keyword term="Buffer" />A buffer is the memory in your <a href="Printer.htm" target="_popup">printer</a> or <a href="embosser.htm" target="_popup">embosser</a> where data can be stored while it waits to be output. A large buffer is better than a small one. Your computer will quickly send data until the buffer is full, and after that, it will <a href="handshake.htm" target="_popup">handshake</a> to keep the buffer full. Of course, the computer can only send data as fast as the printer will print it. When a computer is busy handshaking, other operations are slowed down, or possibly even halted.</p>
