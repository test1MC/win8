        <p>A floppy diskette is a storage device on which you can store such things as computer programs and document files. Unlike a <a href="hard_disk.htm" target="_popup">hard disk,</a> a floppy diskette is not permanently attached to your computer. You can easily remove a floppy diskette to bring it to another computer. When no <a href="network.htm" target="_popup">network</a> is available, a floppy drive might provide the best means for sharing information among several computers.</p>
