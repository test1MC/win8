        <p>A file extension which was typically used with earlier versions of The Duxbury Braille Translator to represent text before translation into braille.</p>
        <p>In order to ensure proper translation and formatting, such TXT files typically contained Duxbury dollar codes his version of DBT refers to such files as Duxbury coded text files. Note, however, that not all files with an extension of TXT are Duxbury coded text files.</p>
        <p>Many TXT files will not contain any Duxbury coding at all. To bring these into DBT, you should import them as Formatted print files.</p>
