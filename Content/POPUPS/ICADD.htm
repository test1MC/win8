        <p>ICADD is the International Committee for Accessible Document Design. Its goal is to help print publishers produce files which can be easily output in alternative formats, such as cassette, large print and braille. ICADD decided upon <a href="Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language.htm" target="_popup">SGML</a> as the main solution, and from there created a simple DTD consisting of just 22 tags. The 22 tags represent the most critical text elements found in printed material, including headings, paragraphs, lists, etc..</p>
        <p>Most DTD's, with only print in mind, have more tags, including tags for tables, graphic images, and the like. DBT can <a href="import.htm" target="_popup">import</a> and <a href="export.htm" target="_popup">export</a> SGML/ICADD files to help braille producers who receive files from publishers who conform to the ICADD specification.</p>
