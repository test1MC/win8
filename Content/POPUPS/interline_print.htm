        <p>Interline Print generally refers to braille which is double line spaced on each side of the page, but where one side will emboss on lines 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., and 2, 4, 6, 8., etc on the other side. DBT also uses this term to describe ink-printed documents that show braille and the print equivalent of each line in the space between braille lines.</p>
