            <MadCap:keyword term="Master disks" />Master disks are the disks you receive with any piece of software, in this case DBT. They contain the software exactly as it was shipped to you by the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="CDs" />In order to protect your software investment, it is important to make a backup copy of master diskettes or CDs as soon as you receive new software. Both the original set and the backup set should be filed away as soon as you have installed the software.</p>
