        <p><MadCap:keyword term="CBC" /><MadCap:keyword term="Computer Braille:Code" />Computer Braille Code (CBC) was developed by BANA in the early 1980's so that blind computer operators could have a strict one-for-one equivalence, with capital indicators, for text written in computerese. Some of the contractions in braille would be hard to distinguish from special characters, such as slash (/), if literary was used for computerese. CBC is nearly identical to ASCII braille equivalents in its character mapping.</p>
