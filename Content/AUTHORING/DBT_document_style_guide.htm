        <h1>Duxbury Document Style Guide</h1>
        <p>One of the single most important things to be aware of when authoring text, is to use Styles.</p>
        <p>This is not really any different to using Styles in Word for Windows, which of course is highly recommended when using DBT.</p>
        <p>However we do need to define a "Corporate set of Styles" for all documentation.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, Flare's use of *.css files allows Styles to be defined for various types of output. </p>
        <p>For now, we ideally need to re-define Heading and Normal Styles for XHTML and Printed output. Others will follow.</p>
        <p>ANY IDEAS?</p>
        <h2 class="NoNewPage">Images:</h2>
        <p>&lt;img&gt; Style is currently set with a clear border all round of 6 Points. This is generally used where an image is to be centered in text.</p>
        <p>&lt;img.flag&gt; Style is currently set with a clear border all round of 6 Points and is genarlly only to be used where flags are displayed in the likes ofHeadings</p>
        <p>I think we need an img.ctr style for when an image in on it's own in a paragraph.</p>
