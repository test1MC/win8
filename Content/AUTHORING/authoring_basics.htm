        <h1>Authoring Basics - From George Alone</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this group of documents is to attempt to lay out a set of general guidelines for not only Help Topics, but alternative formats of material which may be made available.</p>
        <h2 class="NoNewPage">Madcap Flare</h2>
        <p>The software used to produce Help systems in various Duxbury products is "Flare" produced by MadCap Software. (http://www.madcapsoftware.com/)</p>
        <p>The single most important feature of this software is what is known as "Single-Source".</p>
        <p>In its simplest form of use, this means that while a set of Topics, can produce a Help file (*.chm), the same Topics can also produce a variety of alternative outputs such as Word for Windows, PDF, iPhone, eBooks and many others including the ability to publish to the Web. Moreover, this can be done in a very short space of time.</p>
        <p>Many additional Flare features include such things as "Snippets" where for example the same text which might normally be copied and pasted into many topics can be added very easily.</p>
        <p>"Variables" allow text, such as the current DBTVersion and date, used throughout the project, to be changed in just one place.</p>
        <p>I just wanted to forewarn you that I am moving virtually everything out of the Contents/Perky folder since huge chunks are as per DBT’s Help.</p>
        <p>However, I do see occasions where DBT screen shots have “DBT” in the dialog Headings and text.</p>
        <p>I have therefore done as I have with Mac versions, and suffixed “_perky” to the file name.  Hopefully if changes are required, it will help spot any “specials” if they are in alphabetical order.</p>
        <p>Where a screen shot is, or will likely be, used in Perky and DBT for Windows, I have added and applied a Condition called “Perky_and_DBTW”. This means we can have a “Perky_and_DBTM” when required.</p>
        <p>As regards the text element, in some cases I’ve rephrased the text to take out “DBT” and in others I’ve made use of Conditional text.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>This is a change from Marvin!</p>
