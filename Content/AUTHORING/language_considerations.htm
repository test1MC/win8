        <h1>Language Considerations</h1>
        <p>Currently a number of Duxbury products are available where the on-screen contents such as menus, prompts and dialogues are in a non-English language.</p>
        <p>However, Help is usually in English, and users often rely on a Translation Engine to translate content into their own language.</p>
        <p>There is however an option for Flare called "Lingo" - (<a href="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/lingo/">http://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/lingo/</a>). The current (July 2016) cost of this add-on is $798. This would allow interested parties to translate Help into their own language.</p>
        <p>Should anyone be interested, please do not quote any costings until a fuller estimate of the work required has been done.</p>
        <h2 class="NoNewPage">Golden Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1) Avoid the use of apostrophes.</li>
            <li>2) Avoid the use of coloquialisms.</li>
            <li>3) If technical terms require to be used, try to explain as simply as possible.</li>
        </ul>
