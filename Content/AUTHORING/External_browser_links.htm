        <h1>External Browser Links</h1>
        <p>Many web sites are unhappy when opened in Flare.</p>
        <p>The solution is to set Flare to open the link in the browser as opposed to within Flare/Help.</p>
        <p>This simply requires selecting the "Target Frame" as "New Window/Tab" when Inserting or Editing a Hyperlink as shown in the following screen shot.</p>
        <p>A further benefit in some cases is that users can then close Help and work in DBT while the web page remains open. e.g. to copy and paste.</p>
