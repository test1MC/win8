        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Biblical Original Language Studies tables support print-to-braille translation of English-language, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Syriac and Coptic, European languages, in a manner designed to support the needs of braille-reading biblical scholars. This table is a work in progress. Those wishing to participate should contact <a href="mailto:languages@duxsys.com?subject=Biblical Original Language Studies" title="languages@duxsys.com" alt="languages@duxsys.com">languages@duxsys.com</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.duxburysystems.com/lan_biblical_scholar.htm" title="This link requires Internet access" alt="This link requires Internet access">The functional summary of what this table does is best found by following this link.</a>
        </p>
        <p>The handling of Roman script text follows the specifications of Unified English Braille (UEB or UEBC, also formerly known as UBC) that was developed by the International Council on English Braille (<a href="http://www.iceb.org/" title="External link to website of the International Council for English Braille" alt="External link to website of the International Council for English Braille">ICEB</a>) from 1992 to 2004 and that has been maintained by that body since then. In early April 2004, the ICEB General Assembly declared that UEBC was sufficiently complete and ready for possible adoption by the ICEB's constituent national authorities.</p>
        <h5>Braille to Print (aka Back-translation)</h5>
        <p>Braille-to-print translation is not supported for this table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The DBT translation codes may or may not be supported in the same way that they are supported in the English/Unified table. Users can test whether these codes work.</p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese</p>
        <p>Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac and Coptic scripts</p>
        <p>British pound, Japanese yen, Euro, and other miscellaneous signs (DUSCI pages D+ec..., D+ed..., D+ee..., D+f5...)</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The earliest versions of this table were created in 2014 by mixing the translation tables for English/Unified with Arabic, Greek, and Hebrew tables. A table for Syriac and Coptic was added based on the work of a committee described below.</p>
        <p>This committee (listed in alphabetic order) consisted of:<body><li class="NormalNJ">David Holladay (Duxbury Systems)<br />Sarah Blake LaRose (blind biblical scholar)<br />Ray McAllister (blind biblical scholar)<br />Caryn Navy (Duxbury Systems)<br />Matthew Yeater (blind biblical scholar)</li></body></p>
        <p>Since so much of this work is new, we all wanted to form a committee that could work together on this common goal. We should acknowledge the role of Matthew Yeater for initiating this work when he needed a braille translation table specially crafted to handle "Critical Analysis" notation (Nestle-Aland notation). Everyone in the committee wishes to thank Duxbury Systems their help in producing this tool for the blind biblical scholar.</p>
