        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The European Braille Union (EBU) Pharmaceutical tables support translation of text to braille according to the specifications of the European Blind Union (EBU) as published in October 2005.</p>
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>The EBU Pharmaceutical specifications ("Basic Chart of Braille Signs," developed by the EBU in October 2005 and subsequently published at http://www.mhra.gov.uk) include provisions only for characters normally found in the labeling of pharmaceuticals. Certain characters commonly found in ordinary literary text, such as the exclamation mark (!), are not included in the specifications and so are not supported. Characters not in the specifications will generally result in the word "error", between braille parentheses, appearing at the corresponding position in the braille output.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No secondary languages are supported.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No technical braille codes are supported.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the EBU Pharmaceutical table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~...]</span> -- all typeforms are ignored</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~...]</span> -- all typeforms are ignored</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[one]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ons]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tne]</span> -- treated as parenthesis</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tns]</span> -- treated as parenthesis</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span></p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the characters specifically mentioned in the EBU Pharmaceutical specification, as described above, namely:</p>
        <p>The Latin letters a-z (ignoring case).</p>
        <p>Some common accented Latin letters (which will result in dot 4 preceding the letter in braille). (Not all possible accent combinations are supported.)</p>
        <p>Digits 0-9.</p>
        <p>Space; open and close round parentheses; comma (,); semicolon (;); colon (:); full stop/abbreviation point/decimal point (.); oblique stroke (/); hyphen (-); dash (--); percent (%).</p>
        <p>British pound, Japanese yen, and dollar signs.</p>
        <p>The Greek letter mu (used as a prefix meaning "micro").</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The earliest support for EBU Pharmaceutical braille was as a special "variant" mode with the English/British tables, in September 2007. A separate table was developed by Duxbury Systems in February 2008, based upon the published sources mentioned above and with technical advice from George Bell of Techno-Vision Systems Ltd. in the U.K.</p>
