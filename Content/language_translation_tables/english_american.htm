        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">eng-xna</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The English/American tables support print-to-braille translation of English-language literary text, following the codes and customs established by the Braille Authority of North America (BANA). Several other languages may also be processed as sub-languages, and transcribed in accordance with BANA practice -- which is uncontracted braille, except for Maori. Braille using the additional English "religious contractions" may also optionally be produced (see "Secondary Languages Supported," below.) Technical codes for math and science (Nemeth Code) and computer notation (Computer Braille Code) are also supported.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is supported within English text and Computer Braille Code, but not in languages other than English nor in mathematics. This means that any mathematics or foreign-language portions of a braille file will not translate correctly to print. It also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when the cursor is in mathematics or embedded foreign-language braille.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Several other languages may be entered and treated per BANA specifications, i.e. as secondary languages, using the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng...]</span> code to switch. For instance, <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~fr]</span> (or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~fra]</span>) would introduce a French passage, which would be terminated, i.e. reverting to English, at <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng]</span> (or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~en]</span>or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~eng]</span>). The available languages, together with their associated "lng" codes, are:</p>
        <p>de (or deu) -- German</p>
        <p>en (or eng) -- English</p>
        <p>es (or esp) -- Spanish</p>
        <p>fi -- Finnish</p>
        <p>fr (or fra) -- French</p>
        <p>it (or ita) -- Italian</p>
        <p>la (or lat) -- Latin</p>
        <p>mi (or mao) -- Maori</p>
        <p>nl -- Dutch</p>
        <p>pt -- Portuguese</p>
        <p>sv -- Swedish</p>
        <p>sw -- Swahili (Kiswahili)</p>
        <p>In Maori text, one contraction ("wh") is normally used, and it will be used as long as grade two is in effect. The other languages are all transcribed in grade 1 regardless of the grade setting, as is normal BANA practice. That is, the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> and <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> codes affect the English text and any Maori text, but not the other languages.</p>
        <p>Finally, certain producers of religious materials, and their readers, traditionally employ a short list of contractions that augment the standard set. While the language of course remains English, this is handled as English transcribed according to a variant code, using the same mechanism as a "secondary" language. Specifically, after the command <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~en-rlg]</span>, the religious contractions are enabled while in grade 2. This effect is terminated at <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng]</span>, when processing returns to standard English treatment.</p>
        <p>In addition to the secondary languages supported as described above within the English/American table itself, it is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.) When switching in that manner, translation is in accordance with the language and standard-setting authority associated with that other table.</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The BANA math and science code, i.e. Nemeth Code (1972), and the BANA computer notation code, i.e. CBC, are supported. See the Topical How-To Guide (under "Help"), and other relevant documentation.</p>
        <p>If required for special purposes, it is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables list in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table. When switching in that manner, translation is in accordance with the language and standard-setting authority associated with that other table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the English/American table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>

        <p>[atx0] turns off the "all ASCII is literal" mode (see next code description), so that certain traditional "codes" typed in as direct text will continue to have effect. (For a list of these, see "Special Print Text Codes" within the "Codes Quick Reference" on DBT's Help menu.) This is presently the default (initial) condition, but as that is likely to change in future versions, it is advisable to put an <span class="Code-DuxCode">[atx0]</span>code at the beginning of any file in which the traditional in-text codes are used.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[atx1]</span> turns on an "all ASCII is literal" mode, which will cause all ordinary printable ASCII characters to be considered as literal text, even those sequences that have traditionally been used as special "codes".</p>

        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~inf]</span>establishes "informal mode," wherein certain ASCII characters that are not defined in BANA literary braille, and which according to the strict interpretation of that code must therefore be represented as one or more words in braille (e.g. "greater-than" for "&gt;"), are instead given informal but generally familiar representations (e.g. dots 3-4-5 in that case). Note that the definition of this code may be changed or discontinued in future versions. This code cancels the effect of any other <span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~...]</span> code, and its own effect lapses at any subsequent <span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~...]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[ts]</span> code.</p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese</p>
        <p>British pound, Japanese yen, Euro, and other miscellaneous signs (DUSCI pages D+ec..., D+ed..., D+ee..., D+f5...)</p>
        <p>Mathematical signs, shapes, etc. (in "technical context," i.e. Nemeth Code, only) (DUSCI pages D+df..., D+e2..., D+e5..., D+ef..., D+f0..., D+f1...)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "General Notes" section under the main “Language Translation Tables” topic).</p>

        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>These tables are based primarily upon the definitive manual for North American literary braille usage, namely "English Braille American Edition," a publication of the Braille Authority of North America (BANA), 2007 revision. "The Nemeth Braille Code for Mathematics and Science Notation, 1972 Revision" and "Code for Computer Braille Notation" (1987) define the mathematics and computer notation codes followed; both are also BANA publications.</p>
        <p>The literary portions of the tables were adapted in July 1975 by Duxbury Systems, Inc., working from the similar tables in DOTSYS III, a public-domain braille translator written at MITRE Corporation around 1969. Extensive additions and updates by Duxbury since that time have included support for Computer Braille Code (CBC) in March 1988 and support for mathematics and science (Nemeth Code [1972]) in March 1997.</p>
        <p>BANA updates through that of 2007 have been followed.</p>
