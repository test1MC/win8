        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">eng-xueb</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The English/Unified tables support print-to-braille translation of English-language literary text, following the specifications of Unified English Braille (UEB or UEBC, also formerly known as UBC) that was developed by the International Council on English Braille (ICEB) from 1992 to 2004 and that has been maintained by that body since then. In early April 2004, the ICEB General Assembly declared that UEBC was sufficiently complete and ready for possible adoption by the ICEB's constituent national authorities. In a given nation, therefore, UEB may or may not be approved for general use; users should verify the status before assuming that it is approved.</p>
        <p>Several languages other than English may also be processed as sub-languages, and transcribed in uncontracted braille (except for Maori, which has only one contraction).</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Normal braille-to-print translation is supported only within English literary text. In English technical text, such as mathematics, the braille is translated to a "coded" form that is eventually designed to allow export to LaTeX or other means of displaying normal print mathematics -- but in the short run is readable only as codes. Any braille not in UEB, such as foreign-language passages, will not translate correctly to print. This also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when the cursor is in embedded foreign-language braille.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Several other languages may be entered and treated as "in English context," using the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng...]</span> code to switch. For instance, <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~fr]</span> (or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~fra]</span>) would introduce a French passage, which would be terminated, i.e. reverting to English, at <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng]</span> (or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~en]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~eng]</span>). The available languages, together with their associated "<span class="Code-DuxCode">lng</span>" codes, are:</p>
        <p class="CodeList">de (or deu) -- German</p>
        <p class="CodeList">en (or eng) -- English</p>
        <p class="CodeList">es (or esp) -- Spanish</p>
        <p class="CodeList">fi -- Finnish</p>
        <p class="CodeList">fr (or fra) -- French</p>
        <p class="CodeList">it (or ita) -- Italian</p>
        <p class="CodeList">la (or lat) -- Latin</p>
        <p class="CodeList">mi (or mao) -- Maori</p>
        <p class="CodeList">nl -- Dutch</p>
        <p class="CodeList">pt -- Portuguese</p>
        <p class="CodeList">sv -- Swedish</p>
        <p class="CodeList">sw -- Swahili</p>
        <p>In Maori text, one contraction ("wh") is normally used, and it will be used as long as grade two is in effect. The other languages are all transcribed in grade 1 regardless of the grade setting. That is, the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> and <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> codes affect the English text and any Maori text, but not the other languages.</p>
        <p>Note that in addition to the above-listed "secondary languages" supported within the English/Unified table itself, it is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No separate technical braille codes are supported. UEB itself incorporates technical notation such as for mathematics, science and computer material, and so no separate technical code is needed for such material. The method for entering mathematics and other technical notation is the same as for the technical codes supported in the English/American and English/British tables, and translation of such notation to UEB is supported.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the English/Unified table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>

        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ucl0~"]</span> establishes that the ordinary keyboard double quote (U+0022) is to be interpreted flexibly, i.e. as an opening quote or a closing quote according to the immediate context. This is the default (initial) condition.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ucl1~"]</span> establishes that the ordinary keyboard double quote (U+0022) is to be interpreted literally, i.e. as a nondirectional double quote, and translated as such in UEB.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ucs]</span> marks the beginning of a capital passage when it is desirable to override the automatic logic for determining capital passages. All letters between <span class="Code-DuxCode">[ucs]</span> ... <span class="Code-DuxCode">[uce]</span> pairs are treated as capitals regardless of their actual case.</p>

        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq]</span> causes the prevailing quote marks to be "unset," which is the default (initial) condition. When the prevailing quote marks are unset, the first actual quote mark (of those listed above) next encountered in the file determines the prevailing quote mark for the rest of the file unless until a subsequent <span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq...]</span> command is encountered.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~"]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~0022]</span> sets the prevailing (or "outer") opening and closing quote to the ordinary keyboard double-quote (<span class="Code-DuxScreen">"</span>), i.e. U+0022.

        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~`]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~0060]</span> sets the prevailing opening and closing quote to the grave accent character (<span class="Code-DuxScreen">`</span>), i.e. U+0060. </p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~«]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~00ab]</span> sets the prevailing opening quote to the left-pointing double angle quotation mark (<span class="Code-DuxScreen">«</span>), i.e. U+00ab, and the prevailing closing quote to the corresponding right-pointing mark.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~»]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[uoq~00bb]</span> sets the prevailing opening quote to the right-pointing double angle quotation mark (<span class="Code-DuxScreen">»</span>), i.e. U+00bb, and the prevailing closing quote to the corresponding left-pointing mark.</p>
        <p class="bold">Generally speaking, any need to use a<span class="Code-DuxCode"> [uoq...]</span> command would be very rare, as the default behavior should establish the actual quote pattern (e.g. single outer, double inner, or vice versa) correctly and provide the correct UEB treatment automatically.</p>

        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~ida]</span> establishes a mode wherein dashes are treated informally. Specifically, a space at either end of a dash is not preserved in the braille, and double hyphens and spaced single hyphens are treated as full dashes (i.e. em-dashes).</p>

        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese</p>
        <p>British pound, Japanese yen, Euro, and other miscellaneous signs (DUSCI pages D+ec..., D+ed..., D+ee..., D+f5...)</p>
        <p>Mathematical signs, shapes, etc. (DUSCI pages D+df..., D+e2..., D+e5..., D+ef..., D+f0..., D+f1...)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>

        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The earliest versions of this table were adapted by Duxbury Systems in October 1992 from the then-current English/American tables. As the definition of UEB evolved from that time, the tables were updated periodically.</p>
        <p>The original derivation process was repeated in September 2000, in accordance with the definition of UEB as of that time, per the documentation posted on the web site for the International Council on English Braille (ICEB) (http://www.iceb.org).</p>
        <p>Subsequent decisions of ICEB's UEB Committee, up to and including the decisions regarding the treatment of shortforms concluded in early 2010, have been followed and are reflected in this table.</p>
