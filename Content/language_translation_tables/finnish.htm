        <p class="DBTCodePara">fin</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h6>2014 NOTE: The Finnish Template has been modified to produce a blank line between paragraphs.</h6>
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Finnish Uncontracted tables support print-to-braille translation of Finnish-language literary text in grade 1 (uncontracted) braille only.</p>
        <p>Automatic hyphenation of the braille (that is, automatic introduction of assisted-hyphenation codes during the translation to braille) is supported by default, though it can be turned on and off by translation codes.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>There are no special requirements or limitations.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No secondary languages are supported.</p>
        <p>Note that while no "secondary languages" are supported within the Finnish table itself, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No technical codes are supported.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Finnish table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[/]</span> -- ignored</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ab]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ahy]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[ahy1]</span>turns on automatic hyphenation of the braille (which is initial and default condition)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ah0]</span>turns off automatic hyphenation of the braille.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> switches to "grade 1" (uncontracted) braille (which is always in effect anyway).</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> is allowed but ignored with this table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[in]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng...]</span> -- ignored.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span>
        </p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, and Finnish.</p>
        <p>British pound sign</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>These tables were developed by Duxbury Systems, Inc. The original September 1997 version was based upon the information given for Finnish in "World Braille Usage," a joint publication of UNESCO and the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Washington, D.C. (1990). They were updated in May 2002 per later information provided by Marja-Leena Kartovaara of the Finnish Library for the Visually Impaired.</p>
        <p>Duxbury Systems is also grateful to Mr. Reijo Juntunen of the Finnish Federation of the Visually Impaired for further clarifications and in particular for providing rules for Finnish braille hyphenation.</p>
