        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Bengali (Bangla) tables support print-to-braille translation of Bengali (Bangla)-language literary text into uncontracted Bengali (Bangla) braille, following the braille rules published in Bangladesh in 1996.</p>
        <p>We are supporting the SutonnyMJ font, which is a popular non-Unicode font used in Bangledesh. Any of the scripts generally used in India and surrounding regions (Arabic [including Sindhi], Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Myanmar, Oriya, Sinhala, Tamil or Telegu) may be used. Bengali (Bangla) is usually written in Bengali Script.</p>
        <p>Roman script will generally be transcribed as in uncontracted English.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Although DBT Win <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Static_Version_11.1" /> and later are able to display accented letter combinations and many non-Roman scripts, it is nevertheless often more convenient to use Microsoft Word for entering and editing print text, which can then be imported into DBT for subsequent translation. When preparing the text in Word, be sure to use a Unicode font (such as Lucida Sans or the default Times Roman), so that the underlying characters are encoded in Unicode. (Note that the appearance on screen is not the issue. Fonts that merely cause standard ASCII characters to be displayed as the desired accented or non-Roman letters will not work, because they will be imported according to their standard interpretation, not their appearance.)</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Roman script will generally be transcribed as in uncontracted English.</p>
        <p>There are no secondary languages supported within the Bengali (Bangla) table itself; however it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No specific technical braille codes are supported directly within the Bengali (Bangla) table itself. Technical (mathematics, computer, or scientific) notation is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB) or one of the other English codes. It is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Bengali (Bangla) table. Codes related to the entry of type forms, mathematics, etc. as in the English/Unified (UEB) tables may also be used and will in most instances be treated as in UEB or one of the other English codes. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span>
        </p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Letters and punctuation marks from any Indic script (Bengali, Devanagari, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Sinhala, Tamil or Telegu), Arabic (including Sindhi), or Myanmar.</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>These tables are based on the Bengali table for India, developed in association of Mr. Dipendra Manocha. We are grateful for the assistence from Broja Gopal Saha and his associates at the Centre for Disability in Development in Dacca for helping us to modify the table to handle the official braille rules for Bangladesh.</p>
