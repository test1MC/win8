        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">tha</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Thai tables support print-to-braille translation of Thai-language literary text into uncontracted Thai braille.</p>
        <p>Uncontracted English is also supported. Technical (mathematics and computer) notation is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB).</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Although DBT Win <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Static_Version_11.1" /> and later are able to display accented letter combinations and many non-Roman scripts, it is nevertheless often more convenient to use Microsoft Word for entering and editing print text, which can then be imported into DBT for subsequent translation. When preparing the text in Word, be sure to use a Unicode font (such as Lucida Sans or the default Times Roman), so that the underlying characters are encoded in Unicode. (Note that the appearance on screen is not the issue. Fonts that merely cause standard ASCII characters to be displayed as the desired accented or non-Roman letters will not work, because they will be imported according to their standard interpretation, not their appearance.)</p>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is not supported. This means that it is not generally useful to translate an Thai braille file to print. It also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when viewing the braille file. You may prefer to turn off the "translated line" under the View menu, or even under Global/Default if you wish it to be off by default.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Roman script is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB).</p>
        <p>There are no secondary languages supported within the Thai table itself; however it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Technical (mathematics, computer, or scientific) notation is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB). It is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Thai table. Codes related to the entry of type forms, mathematics, etc. as in the English/Unified tables may also be used and will generally be treated in the same way. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span>
        </p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Thai letters and punctuation marks</p>
        <p>Mathematical signs, shapes, etc. (DUSCI pages D+df..., D+e2..., D+e5..., D+ef..., D+f0..., D+f1...)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "General Notes" section under the main “Language Translation Tables” topic).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The Thai tables support print-to-braille translation of Thai-language literary text into uncontracted braille. It is based on matching the characters found in the Unicode standard with <b>World Braille Useage, 1990</b> and The Wikipedia article on Thai Braille at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Braille">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Braille</a></p>
        <p>We came into contact with Wiraman Niyomphol. He identified the countless times that the character ordering of Unicode conflicted with the character ordering of braille. These have been fixed in the present translator.</p>
        <p>One major problem with the Thai translator is line endings. Thai braille does not use spaces to show word divisions. But without spaces, Duxbury DBT does not know how to divide lines into words. We await a solution to this issue. We welcome comments to improve these tables.</p>
