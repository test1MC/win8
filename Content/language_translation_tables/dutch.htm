        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">nld</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Dutch tables support print-to-braille translation of Dutch-language literary text in grade 2 (contracted) or grade 1 (uncontracted) braille.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>There are no special requirements or limitations.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No secondary languages are supported. However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No technical codes are supported.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Dutch table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[/]</span> -- ignored</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ab]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~b]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~i]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~b]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~i]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> switches to "grade 1" (uncontracted) braille.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1l]</span> switches to "grade 1" (uncontracted) braille and "locks" that setting.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1u]</span> undoes the "locking" effect of a prior <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1l]</span>, while leaving the contraction grade as "grade 1" (uncontracted) braille.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> switches to "grade 2" (contracted) braille (which is the normal mode for this table).</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2l]</span> switches to "grade 2" (contracted) braille and "locks" that setting.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2u]</span> undoes the "locking" effect of a prior <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2l]</span>, while leaving the contraction grade as "grade 2" (contracted) braille.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[in]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng...]</span> -- ignored.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span></p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, and Spanish</p>
        <p>British pound sign (£)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>These tables are based upon the information given for Dutch in "World Braille Usage," a joint publication of UNESCO and the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Washington, D.C. (1990).</p>
        <p>Uncontracted Dutch tables were originally developed in September 1997 by Duxbury Systems, Inc. Mr. Marten Post Uiterweer has provided feedback used in subsequent revisions of those tables. In March 2004, at the request of Dr. John Gardner of ViewPlus Technologies, Suzanne M. van den Bercken provided information on the few contractions commonly used in Dutch braille, which gave rise to these contracted tables.</p>
