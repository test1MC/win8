        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Greek (Modern)/Uncontracted tables support print-to-braille translation of Greek-language literary text in uncontracted modern Greek braille. English text may also be processed as a sub-language, and converted to contracted or uncontracted English braille (following British conventions). The American Computer Braille Code (CBC) is also supported.</p>
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Although DBT version 10.5 and later can display Greek characters properly, it is often more convenient to use an external word processor to compose and edit the print text that is to be translated. When doing so, it is necessary to use a facility that encodes the text in Unicode so that it can be imported correctly to DBT. (Some methods of entering Greek rely upon a variant "font" to display standard ASCII characters as Greek. Those methods cannot be used, as those ASCII characters would be imported according to their standard interpretation, not as Greek characters.)</p>
        <p>Microsoft Word, properly used, fulfills the above requirements.</p>

        <h5>When you view material with Greek</h5>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is supported only within any embedded English text, not in the Greek text. This means that it is not generally useful to translate the Greek braille file to print. It also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when viewing the braille file -you may prefer to turn off the "translated line" under the View menu, or even under Global/Default if you wish it to be off by default.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>English text may be entered as a secondary language, and converted to contracted or uncontracted English braille. That is, the grade switches affect the translation of the English text even though the Greek text is always translated in grade 1 regardless of the grade setting in effect. In literary text, British conventions are generally followed, to the extent that they sometimes differ slightly from American ones.</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The Computer Braille Code, as in the English/American tables, is supported.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[/]</span> may be embedded within letter-groups that would normally be contracted, to prevent the contraction.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ab]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~b]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~i]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~u]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~b]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~i]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~u]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> switches to "grade 1" (uncontracted) braille. This does not affect the Greek text, which is uncontracted anyway, but does affect any embedded English text.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> switches to "grade 2" (contracted) braille. This is the normal mode, but actually applies only to any embedded English text as the Greek text is always uncontracted.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[in]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~en]</span> switches to English language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~el]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng]</span> switches to Greek language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span> resumes normal translation, ending "direct braille."</p>
        <p>Other translation codes will generally be ignored, or may cause unpredictable translation results.</p>
