        <p>What, if anything, appears here will depend on the language you have chosen. Essentially this will usually be one of the English Languages.</p>
        <p>Currently there are three Graduated tables following braille teaching courses.</p>
        <p><a href="..\miscellaneous\Learning_Braille\fingerprint_units.htm">Fingerprint</a> from the Royal National Institute of the Blind, United Kingdom.</p>
        <p><a href="..\miscellaneous\Learning_Braille\nls.htm">NLS</a> - National Library Service for the Blind, United States</p>
        <p><a href="..\miscellaneous\Learning_Braille\tsvbi.htm">TSVBI</a> - Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired, United States</p>
        <p>These allow you to select a Translation Table which only contains certain contractions according to the Unit, Section or Cluster the student has reached in learning braille.</p>
