        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Shona tables support print-to-braille and braille-to-print translation of Shona-language literary text in uncontracted Shona braille. The tables can be described as uncontracted letters, with punctuation and numbers following English Unified Braille (UEB) usage.</p>
        <p>The Shona tables can be used for other languages of Africa, whose text is free of accented or unusual characters. The Shona tables are useful for dozens of languages in Africa.</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>These tables were implemented by Duxbury Systems, Inc. based on its understanding of Shona braille.</p>
