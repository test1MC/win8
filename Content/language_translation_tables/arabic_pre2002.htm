        <p class="DBTCodePara">ara-x02</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Arabic tables support print-to-braille translation of Arabic-language literary text in contracted or uncontracted Arabic braille according to Arabic Braille rules as they were prior to a major revision that took place in 2002. English text may also be processed as a sub-language, and converted to contracted or uncontracted English braille (following British conventions). The American Computer Braille Code (CBC) is also supported.</p>
        <p>Normally, the text is first prepared on Microsoft Word (possibly Arabic version, but any version can be used as long as the Arabic is prepared in a Unicode font [e.g. the default "Times Roman"]) and imported to DBT prior to translation.</p>
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is supported only within any embedded English text, not in the Arabic text. This means that it is not generally useful to translate an Arabic braille file to print. It also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when viewing the braille file. You may prefer to turn off the "translated line" under the View menu, or even under Global/Default if you wish it to be off by default.</p>
        <p>Arabic characters may not be shown normally on the "print file" view of DBT, and in any case the normal (right-to-left) directionality of Arabic text is not supported in that view. This is the main reason that Microsoft Word should normally be used for entering, editing and viewing the print text and the DBT print view is used only as an intermediary step enroute to the braille.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>English text may be entered as a secondary language, and converted to contracted or uncontracted English braille. That is, the grade switches affect the translation of the English text as well as the Arabic text. In English literary text, British conventions are generally followed, to the extent that they sometimes differ slightly from American ones.</p>
        <p>In addition, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Computer Braille Code (CBC), as defined by the Braille Authority of North America, is supported.</p>
        <p>In addition, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>

        <p>Other translation codes will generally be ignored, or may cause unpredictable translation results.</p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Letters and vowel marks used in Arabic</p>
        <p>Accented letters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, and Spanish</p>
        <p>British pound sign (£)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The rules for contracted Arabic were originally specified by the former Middle East Committee for the Welfare of the Blind (now under the auspices of the Department of Education) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Working from that specification, Duxbury Systems developed an automated braille translation system for Arabic, believed to be the first anywhere, which was installed at MECWB in 1982. That original form of the system, designed for DBT as it ran on minicomputers of the early 1980s, was used with only minor updates until the late 1990s. The present tables have been updated to work with the much more advanced Windows version of DBT, to incorporate facilities for embedded English as well as Arabic, and quite possibly to reflect feedback from more recent users.</p>
        <p>The rules for contracted literary English generally follow British practice, but embedded "computer braille", if used, follows the American code -- a combination that is common in many places, e.g. Australia and South Africa.</p>
