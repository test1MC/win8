        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">kat</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Georgian tables support print-to-braille translation of Georgian-language literary text into uncontracted Georgian braille.</p>
        <p>Uncontracted English is also supported. Technical (mathematics and computer) notation is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB).</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Although DBT Win <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Static_Version_11.1" /> and later are able to display accented letter combinations and many non-Roman scripts, it is nevertheless often more convenient to use Microsoft Word for entering and editing print text, which can then be imported into DBT for subsequent translation. When preparing the text in Word, be sure to use a Unicode font (such as Lucida Sans or the default Times Roman), so that the underlying characters are encoded in Unicode. (Note that the appearance on screen is not the issue. Fonts that merely cause standard ASCII characters to be displayed as the desired accented or non-Roman letters will not work, because they will be imported according to their standard interpretation, not their appearance.)</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Roman script is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB).</p>
        <p>There are no secondary languages supported within the Georgian table itself; however it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Technical (mathematics, computer, or scientific) notation is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB). It is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Georgian table. Codes related to the entry of type forms, mathematics, etc. as in the English/Unified tables may also be used and will generally be treated in the same way. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span>
        </p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Georgian letters and punctuation marks</p>
        <p>Mathematical signs, shapes, etc. (DUSCI pages D+df..., D+e2..., D+e5..., D+ef..., D+f0..., D+f1...)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "General Notes" section under the main “Language Translation Tables” topic).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The Georgian tables support print-to-braille translation of Georgian-language literary text into uncontracted braille. It is based on matching the characters found in the Unicode standard with an article on <a href="http://ka.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%83%91%E1%83%A0%E1%83%90%E1%83%98%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1_%E1%83%A8%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98%E1%83%A4%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98">braille from the Georgian-language version of Wikipedia</a>. We welcome comments to improve these tables.</p>
