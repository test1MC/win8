        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">spa-xre</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Spanish/Reducida tables support print-to-braille translation of Spanish-language literary text in grade 1 (uncontracted) or grade 2 (contracted) Spanish braille. The contraction system is one defined to Duxbury Systems by a Mexican braille producer, CIPC.</p>
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is supported only within any grade 1 Spanish passages, not in grade 2. This means that it is not generally useful to translate the Spanish braille file to print unless it is all in grade 1. It also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when viewing any contracted portions of the braille file -you may prefer to turn off the "translated line" under the View menu, or even under Global/Default if you wish it to be off by default.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No secondary languages are supported.</p>
        <p>While no "secondary languages" are supported within the Spanish (Reducida) table itself, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No technical codes are supported.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Spanish (Reducida) table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[/]</span> may be embedded within letter-groups that would normally be contracted, to prevent the contraction.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ab]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~b]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~i]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~u]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~b]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~i]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~u]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> switches to "grade 1" (uncontracted) braille.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> switches to "grade 2" (contracted) braille. This is the normal (initial) mode.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[in]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng...]</span> -- ignored.</p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of Spanish.</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>These were adapted by Duxbury Systems, Inc. in May 1991, working from the then-current Spanish/Original tables. The contraction system followed is defined by a document entitled "Tabla Estenografia Reducida (Espana, 1982)," which was then in use at the <a href="../POPUPS/Comite_Internacional_Pro_Ciegos.htm">Comite International pro Ciegos (CIPC)</a>, Mexico City. The tables are currently maintained by Duxbury Systems, with occasional feedback from the <a href="../POPUPS/Organizaci_n_Nacional_de_Ciegos.htm">Organizacion Nacional de Ciegos Espanoles</a> (ONCE), Madrid, and other sources, and using "Codigo Matematico Unificado para la Lengua Castellana 1987" as a source for some symbols.</p>
