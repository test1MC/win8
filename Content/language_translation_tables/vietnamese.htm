        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">vie</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Vietnamese tables support print-to-braille translation of Vietnamese-language literary text in grade 1 (uncontracted) braille.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>There are no special requirements or limitations.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No secondary languages are supported.</p>
        <p>While no "secondary languages" are supported within the Vietnamese table itself, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Mathematics and other technical notation is translated in a manner generally similar to Unified English Braille (UEB). As of the time these provisions were incorporated (ca. 2001), no specific standard for math transcription in Vietnamese were known to the implementors.</p>
        <p>In addition, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>(Supported codes are substantially similar to those listed for the English/Unified tables.)</p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Tone marks and accents appropriate for Vietnamese language text.</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese</p>
        <p>British pound, Japanese yen, Euro, and other miscellaneous signs (DUSCI pages D+ec..., D+ed..., D+ee..., D+f5...)</p>
        <p>Mathematical signs, shapes, etc. (in "technical context," i.e. Nemeth Code, only) (DUSCI pages D+df..., D+e2..., D+e5..., D+ef..., D+f0..., D+f1...)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The earliest versions of this table were developed by Duxbury Systems in December 1993, working with the Blind Citizens of Australia, primarily on behalf of a school for the blind near Hanoi. In April 2001, that early table was revised by Duxbury Systems for use in the next release of the Windows version of DBT, and the UEB math treatment was added experimentally. The latter work is ongoing, in conjunction with colleagues in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam.</p>
