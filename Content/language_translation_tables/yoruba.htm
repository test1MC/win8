        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">yor</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Yoruba tables support print-to-braille translation of Yoruba-language literary text in grade 2 (contracted) or grade 1 (uncontracted) braille.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>There are no special requirements or limitations.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No secondary languages are supported.</p>
        <p>While no "secondary languages" are supported within the Yoruba table itself, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No technical codes are supported.</p>
        <p>However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Yoruba table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[/]</span> -- ignored</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ab]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span></p>

        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> switches to "grade 2" (contracted) braille, which is the normal mode for this table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ii]</span> switches to grade 1 (uncontracted) braille for one word only.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ii]</span> switches to grade 1 (uncontracted) braille for one word only, and inserts a grade 1 indicator (dot 6).</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[in]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>

        </p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of Yoruba, French, German, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, and Finnish. Although Yoruba letters are basically from the Roman alphabet, the vowels may be marked according to high, middle or low tone using an acute accent, macron, or grave accent respectively. (The mid tone is not normally marked explicitly, but may be in some circumstances.) Likewise some letters (e, o and s) may be marked with a "dot under". Any available precomposed Unicode characters may be used for these marked letters, or the markings may be added to the ordinary letter by entering the applicable "combining" Unicode marks immediately after the basic letter. These combining marks are: U+0323 for combining dot below, U+0300 for combining grave accent (low tone), U+0301 for combining acute accent (high tone), and U+0304 for combining macron. Also, to accommodate a stylistic preference found in some documents, a combining plus below (U+031F) may be used instead of the combining dot below. It is also possible to enter a character using both precomposed and combining Unicode characters -- for example, a precomposed e with acute accent plus a combining dot below. When more than one combining mark is needed, they may be entered in any order as long as all follow the basic letter that they are modifying.</p>
