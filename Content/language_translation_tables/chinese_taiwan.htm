        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">qzh</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Mandarin tables support print-to-braille translation of Mandarin-language literary text into uncontracted Mandarin braille.</p>
        <p>Uncontracted English is also supported. Technical (mathematics and computer) notation is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB).</p>
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Although DBT Win <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Static_Version_11.1" /> and later are able to display accented letter combinations and many non-Roman scripts, it is nevertheless often more convenient to use Microsoft Word for entering and editing print text, which can then be imported into DBT for subsequent translation. When preparing the text in Word, be sure to use a Unicode font (such as Lucida Sans or the default Times Roman), so that the underlying characters are encoded in Unicode. (Note that the appearance on screen is not the issue. Fonts that merely cause standard ASCII characters to be displayed as the desired accented or non-Roman letters will not work, because they will be imported according to their standard interpretation, not their appearance.)</p>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is not supported. This means that it is not generally useful to translate an Mandarin braille file to print. It also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when viewing the braille file. You may prefer to turn off the "translated line" under the View menu, or even under Global/Default if you wish it to be off by default.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Roman script is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB).</p>
        <p>There are no secondary languages supported within the Mandarin table itself; however it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>Technical (mathematics, computer, or scientific) notation is generally transcribed as in Unified English Braille (UEB). It is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Mandarin table. Codes related to the entry of type forms, mathematics, etc. as in the English/Unified tables may also be used and will generally be treated in the same way. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn]</span> cancels any <span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~tN]</span> setting, restoring the normal "minimal" representation of tones.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~tN]</span>, where N is an integer between 0 and 3 inclusive, sets the level for the representation of tones. The meaning of these levels are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>0: No tones are represented.</li>
            <li>1: Representation of tones is "minimal," meaning that only the tone in the syllable "yi" is represented. This is the default setting, so for practical purposes <span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~t1]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn]</span>.</li>
            <li>2: Representation of tones is "maximal," meaning for the present that all tones are represented, i.e. there is no distinction between levels 2 and 3.</li>
            <li>3: All tones are represented.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Mandarin letters and punctuation marks</p>
        <p>Mathematical signs, shapes, etc. (DUSCI pages D+df..., D+e2..., D+e5..., D+ef..., D+f0..., D+f1...)</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "General Notes" section under the main “Language Translation Tables” topic).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>Mandarin braille is based on the Pinyin Romanization. When a Mandarin Microsoft Word file is imported into DBT, it is converted into Pinyin Romanization (see note below). The Microsoft Word importer into Pinyin Romanization is based on information from the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html">Unihan project</a>. The Unihan project does not appear to offer any information as to who provided the data for the Pinyin Romanization for each Unicode Chinese character. Duxbury Systems would like to offer their thanks to whoever did this work.</p>
        <p>For guidance on how Pinyin is written (especially for the rules about the proper placement of accent marks) we used the Wikipedia article: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin</a>This informaton guided Duxbury Systems into allowing the Microsoft Word into DBT file importer to convert Chinese characters into standard Pinyin with appropriately placed tone marks (shown as accents on some of the vowels).</p>
        <p>For information about how to turn Pinyin Romanization into braille, we used 4 different sources:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>World Braille Usage (China page)</li>
            <li>The article <b>How is Chinese written in braille?</b> by Vivian Alridge found at <a href="http://www.braille.ch/pschin-e.htm">www.braille.ch/pschin-e.htm</a></li>
            <li>The Wikipedia article on Chinese Braille at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_braille">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_braille</a></li>
            <li>A faxed one page guide prepared by Judy Bierma of Canada</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Mandarin uses a common codespace in the Unicode for the "Chinese characters". Duxbury DBT handles this by having three separate tables that assist in the file importation from Microsoft Word. Go to Global Menu, Word Importer. There is a new selection for "<b>Default language for Han (Chinese) script</b>". The four choices are <b>Mandarin</b>, <b>Cantonese (Yue)</b>, <b>Korean</b>, and <b>Japanese</b>. Make sure you select <b>Mandarin</b> before importing any files.</p>
