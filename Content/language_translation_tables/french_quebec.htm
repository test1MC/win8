        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">fra-xqu</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The French/Quebec tables support print-to-braille translation of French-language literary text, following the French Braille Code as formerly defined by the Ministry of Education in Quebec, Canada, prior to 1996. That code differed slightly slightly from the then-current French code as defined by the Association Valentin Hauy (AVH), Paris and also from the newer Unified French Code. The American Computer Braille Code (CBC) is also supported.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>See "References, History and Credits" below regarding the maintenance history of this table. Because there were changes to Quebecois French braille in 1996 that may or may not have been incorporated, this table should not be regarded as representative of the code in use after 1996 and prior to the adoption of Unified French.</p>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is supported within French text, but it is based upon the AVH system and so may not always correspond as expected.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No secondary languages are presently supported.</p>
        <p>Note however that it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The American Computer Braille Code (CBC) is supported.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span>code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the French/Quebec table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the<span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>

        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, and Spanish</p>
        <p>British pound and other miscellaneous signs (DUSCI page D+ee...)</p>
        <p>Mathematical signs, shapes, etc. (in "technical context" only) (DUSCI pages D+e2..., D+e5..., D+ef..., D+f0..., D+f1...)</p>
        <p>Note that, for historical reasons and subject to change in future versions, certain printable characters are reserved for "forcing" symbols and indicators, namely:</p>
        <p>D+9b (cent sign): indicator for start of continuous (multi-word) capitals</p>
        <p>D+9d (yen sign): indicator for one word in full capitals D+9f (small script f with hook): indicator for last word in continuous (multi-word) capitals D+f9 (middle dot): forces "abbreviation point" instead of full stop</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>The development of Duxbury's original French tables, upon which these are based, commenced in March 1987, under the sponsorship of the Association Valentin Hauy (AVH), Paris, and as a joint technical effort of Duxbury Systems, Inc. and AVH. The primary specification for French literary braille usage with contractions is "Abrege Orthographique Etendu," a publication of AVH. "Table de Transcription pour la Production du Braille Abrege par Ordinateur," by Michel Jacquin and published by AVH (1986) was also instrumental in this early development.</p>
        <p>The braille-to-print translation tables were added starting in November 1990, with the same sponsors and developers.</p>
        <p>In October 1993, Gerard Cecire of Point-Par-Point, Longueuil, Quebec, Canada, starting with the then-current print-to-braille tables for French Braille per AVH, developed this variant table to conform to the Quebec customs. He made several updates through September 1995.</p>
        <p>Apart from a few minor corrections, there has been no further development of this table. In particular, the changes to the Quebecois braille code that were defined in 1996 have not been systematically incorporated into this table.</p>
