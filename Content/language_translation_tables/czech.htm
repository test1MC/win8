        <h5>TABLE DESIGNATOR</h5>
        <p class="DBTCodePara">ces</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Czech tables support print-to-braille translation of Czech-language literary text into uncontracted Czech braille.</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/Braille_to_Print.flsnp" />
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Although DBT Win <MadCap:variable name="Primary.Static_Version_11.1" /> and later are able to display accented letter combinations and many non-Roman scripts, it is nevertheless often more convenient to use Microsoft Word for entering and editing print text, which can then be imported into DBT for subsequent translation. When preparing the text in Word, be sure to use a Unicode font (such as Lucida Sans or the default Times Roman), so that the underlying characters are encoded in Unicode. (Note that the appearance on screen is not the issue. Fonts that merely cause standard ASCII characters to be displayed as the desired accented or non-Roman letters will not work, because they will be imported according to their standard interpretation, not their appearance.)</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>There are no secondary languages supported within the Czech table itself; however it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No technical braille codes are supported directly within the Czech table itself. However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Czech table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~...]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>

        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of Czech, French, German, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, and Finnish. Although Czech letters are basically from the Roman alphabet, certain letters may be modified with a stroke, caron or acute accent. Precomposed Unicode characters, when available, may be used for these modified letters, or the markings may be added to the ordinary letter by entering the applicable "combining" Unicode marks immediately after the basic letter.</p>
