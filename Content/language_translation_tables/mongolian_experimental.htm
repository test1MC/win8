        <p class="DBTCodePara">mon</p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/TableDesignator.flsnp" />
        <h5>FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY</h5>
        <p>The Mongolia Uncontracted tables support print-to-braille translation of Mongolia-language literary text written in the Cyrillic alphabet. They are intended primarily for use in conjunction with Microsoft Word, or equivalent external facilities for composing and editing the print text that can then be imported into the Duxbury Braille Translator (DBT) for conversion into braille. English text may also be processed as a sub-language, and converted to contracted or uncontracted English braille (generally following British conventions in those minor instances where they differ from American ones). French, Bulgarian, Kazakh and Russian may also be processed as sub-languages.</p>
        <h5>SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITATIONS</h5>
        <p>Even though DBT from version 10.5 onward can display Cyrillic characters, it is usually more convenient to use an external word processor to compose and edit the print text that is to be translated. When doing so, is necessary to use a facility that encodes the text in Unicode so that it can be imported correctly to DBT. (Some methods of entering Cyrillic rely upon a variant "font" to display standard ASCII characters as Cyrillic. Those methods cannot be used, as those ASCII characters would be imported according to their standard interpretation, not as Cyrillic characters.)</p>
        <p>Microsoft Word, properly used, fulfills the above requirements. Use the Lucida Sans Unicode font, or equivalent Unicode font, and a Mongolia (or Cyrillic) keyboard, when entering the Mongolia text.</p>
        <p>True braille-to-print translation is supported only within any embedded English text, not in the Mongolia/Cyrillic text. This means that it is not generally useful to translate the Ukrainian braille file to print. It also means that the "translated line" will typically contain gibberish when viewing the braille file. You may prefer to turn off the "translated line" under the View menu, or even under Global/Default if you wish it to be off by default.</p>
        <h5>SECONDARY LANGUAGES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>English text may be entered as a secondary language, and converted to contracted or uncontracted English braille. That is, the grade switches affect the translation of the English text even though the Mongolia text is always translated in grade 1 regardless of the grade setting in effect. In literary text, British conventions are generally followed, to the extent that they sometimes differ slightly from American ones.</p>
        <p>French language text may be entered; it is brailled as uncontracted French braille, including the dots 46 capital indicator.</p>
        <p>Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Kazakh and Russian language may also be entered; they are brailled in the same way as Mongolia.</p>
        <p>There are no other secondary languages supported within the Mongolia table itself; however it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT. (See the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~…]</span> code below.)</p>
        <h5>TECHNICAL BRAILLE CODES SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>No technical braille codes are supported directly within the Mongolia table itself. However, it is possible to switch to any of the available translation tables listed in DBT (see the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~…]</span> code below), many of which do support various technical codes, such as for mathematics or computer notation, or which support “unified” treatment of technical notation as well as literary text in the base language associated with the table.</p>
        <h5>SUPPORTED DBT TRANSLATION CODES</h5>
        <p>The following DBT translation codes are available when using the Mongolia table. Any other translation codes used will be ignored, or indeed may cause unexpected results. If using an alternative translation table, i.e when switching to another base language table by means of the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~…]</span> code, please refer to the relevant topic and available codes for that table.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[/]</span> may be embedded within letter-groups that would normally be contracted, to prevent the contraction.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[ab]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[caplvN]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode"> N</span> = 1 means no capitals in literary</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode"> N</span> = 3 means capitals are indicated in literary</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~b]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~i]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fte~u]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~b]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~i]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[fts~u]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[cz]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> switches to "grade 1" (uncontracted) braille. This does not affect the Mongolia text, which is uncontracted anyway, but does affect any embedded English text.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2]</span> switches to "grade 2" (contracted) braille. This is the normal mode, but actually applies only to any embedded English text as the Mongolia text is always uncontracted.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[in]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span></p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lnb~…]</span> (for switching to another base [primary] language table)</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~bg]</span> switches to Bulgarian language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~en]</span> switches to English language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~fr]</span> switches to French language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~kk]</span> switches to Kazakh language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~ru]</span> switches to Russian language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng~uk]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[lng]</span> switches to Mongolia language.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[tx]</span> resumes normal translation, ending "direct braille."</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn]</span> cancels <span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~spc]</span>, restoring the normal suppression of spaces after commas and semicolons.</p>
        <p class="CodeList"><span class="Code-DuxCode">[vrn~spc]</span> preserves the spaces following commas and semicolons, which by default are removed in Mongolia braille.</p>
        <h5>CHARACTERS SUPPORTED</h5>
        <p>The table is designed to work with the following groups of characters:</p>
        <p>All ASCII printable characters</p>
        <p>Accented characters and punctuation marks typical of French, German, Italian, and Spanish</p>
        <p>British pound sign (£)</p>
        <p>Cyrillic unaccented characters as needed for the supported languages.</p>
        <p>The above is a general guide only (see "<a href="translation_tables.htm#GENERAL_NOTES">General Notes</a>" section at the beginning of this document).</p>
        <h5>REFERENCES, HISTORY AND CREDITS</h5>
        <p>These tables were originally based upon the information given for Ukrainian and the other supported languages in "World Braille Usage," a joint publication of <a href="../POPUPS/UNESCO.htm">UNESCO</a> and the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped, Washington, D.C. (1990).</p>
        <p>The tables were originally developed in June 2000 by Duxbury Systems, Inc. We are indebted to Oleg Shevkun and J H Fernandez Garza for more recent information that has been used in their maintenance.</p>
