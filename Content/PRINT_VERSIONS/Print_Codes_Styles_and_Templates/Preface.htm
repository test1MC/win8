        <h1>Preface</h1>
        <p>This book is a summary of many of the popular Codes, Styles and Templates used in the Duxbury Braille Translator (DBT). It aims to take some of the mystery out of producing good quality braille.</p>
        <p>However it could not even had begun without the help and support of many, many individuals.</p>
        <p>First are those who encouraged me to even begin writing this in the first place, the many DBT users throughout the world. You asked for help and explanations, and I hope this book will at least begin to answer some of your questions in one volume.</p>
        <p>Thanks go to the many members of staff whom I have bugged like crazy for explanations of the more complex issues which frankly have left me wondering.</p>
        <p>Many skilled users across the globe have also helped provide examples of where they use specific Code and Styles.</p>
        <p>But as with many books, there are two even more important people who need special mention.</p>
        <p>My long suffering wife, Helle, (from Denmark) who has had the patience of a proverbial saint, and has long stopped asking me when I was going to "stop playing on that computer, and come to bed!"</p>
        <p>And of course my proof reader, editor, and mentor, Peter Sullivan, who has had the task of going through every single topic in fine detail, correcting my many mistakes and misunderstandings.</p>
