        <p>Welcome to the first in our series of alternative media describing the Duxbury Braille Translator (DBT). </p>
        <p>This is a Word version of the "The Menus" section from the Help files within DBT. It includes screen shots and therefore should assist in familiarization with the overall system.</p>
        <p>You may find the Table of Contents more detailed than expected, but suffice to say there is indeed a great deal covered, and so we hope this will be of benefit.</p>
        <p>Finally, if you find any broken links, etc., or have any suggestions or comments, please do not hesitate to drop a line to <a href="mailto:info@duxburysystems.com">info@duxburysystems.com</a> and we will do our best to accommodate you in our next version of this publication. </p>
        <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
        <p>It would be a major error on my part if I did not say a very sincere "thank you" to the many people who have been such a great help and support in compiling this book.</p>
        <p>Everyone at Duxbury Systems has been extremely patient and understanding with all the questions I have raised, many of which may have seemed simple or even silly.</p>
        <p>And of course users world-wide, knowingly or unknowingly, have all contributed either directly to me, or through the duxuser list.</p>
        <p>And last, but far from least, my Danish wife, Helle, who has had to put up with me disappearing for hours at a time.</p>
        <p>Thank you one and all.</p>
