        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the DBT for Mac Beta program!</p>
        <p>Thank you for your purchase of this Duxbury software. We appreciate the opportunity to meet your brailling needs, and we appreciate your participation in this Beta period that introduces DBT to the Macintosh platform.</p>
        <p>To provide your feedback and get your questions answered, you can use the e-mail address set up specifically for the Beta program: dbtbeta@duxsys.com. </p>
        <p>To the extent that you can, please contact Duxbury through the above email address. Half of the staff of Duxbury will be monitoring this e-mail list, so that a request for help will soon be answered. Part of the reason for this approach is that the staff answering the phone may not be equipped to handle your situation. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
        <h3>Beta 1 </h3>
        <p>On the immediately following pages you will find a short description of how to install DBT on your Macintosh computer. The installation instructions are brief, but that is mostly because installation is, in fact, quite easy. Most users will not even need most of the pointers and side notes provided.</p>
        <p>The remainder of the installation guide explains how to register and activate your DBT. You need not read the entire guide before doing those tasks. You can go directly to "Licensing and Activation..." on the DBT Help menu and simply follow the wizard through these steps, but this guide is there for you if you need it.</p>
        <p>You will be pleased to know: first, this installation guide will be revised for the next Beta release, and second, once you have DBT installed, the on-line Help for DBT is quite extensive. Please, feel invited to provide your feedback about our Help information as well as the DBT program operation on your Mac.</p>
