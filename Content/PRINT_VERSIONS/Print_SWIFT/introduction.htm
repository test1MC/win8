        <h1 class="chapter">Introduction</h1>
        <p>SWIFT (<b>S</b>end <b>W</b>ord file <b>I</b>mmediately <b>F</b>or <b>T</b>ranslation) was originally developed by a U.K. DBT user many years ago to help in fine tuning some aspects of Word files prior to importing them into DBT. It became very popular as there was more and more demand for importing Word files.</p>
        <p>But with this demand came requests for additional features from users themselves. One in particular was to map Word Styles to DBT braille Styles, especially where Custom Word Styles were being used.</p>
        <p>As time went on, users wanted a facility to make a selection in Word, and only import that into DBT. Now you can select text which is not even contiguous. As DBT's math braille capability increased, many users wanted to simply import the likes of MathType equations.</p>
        <p>One of the new visitors to the duck pond, Tim Burgess from the UK, was tasked with implementing many users' suggestions, and in the specifications for doing this was a line which read, "Make George happy!".</p>
        <p>Well, I am happy, and I hope you will be too.</p>
        <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
        <p>It would be a major error on my part if I did not say a very sincere "thank you" to the many people who have been such a great help and support in compiling this book.</p>
        <p>Everyone at Duxbury Systems has been extremely patient and understanding with all the questions I have raised, many of which may have seemed simple or even silly.</p>
        <p>And, of course, users world-wide, knowingly or unknowingly, have all contributed either directly to me, or through the duxuser list.</p>
        <p>And last, but far from least, my Danish wife, Helle, who has had to put up with me disappearing for hours at a time.</p>
        <p>Thank you one and all.</p>
