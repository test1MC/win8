        <h2><a name="kanchor629"></a>Windows Printer Drivers.</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor630"></a><a name="kanchor631"></a>A common request is, "Can
you tell us where to obtain Windows drivers for our xx braille printer
(embosser)". The simple answer is quite often, "You don't need
any!".</p>
        <p>Printer drivers are special-purpose programs which Windows programs use to
send output to your printer(s). </p>
        <p>The term Windows Device, as used in Duxbury's documentation, refers to a
printer driver that is installed for the purpose of sending output to a braille
embosser rather than an ink printer. There are three advantages to setting up a
Windows Device, rather than having Perky Duck send data to your port. </p>
        <p>The first advantage is that, when Perky Duck is using a Windows Device, it
will usually allow you to return to work, or even exit Perky Duck, before your
whole document has been sent to the embosser. This can be very advantageous if
you often have long documents to emboss. </p>
        <p><a name="kanchor632"></a>The second advantage is that Windows devices need not
be connected directly to your machine. In other words, by configuring a Windows
Device, you enable Perky Duck to work with an embosser elsewhere on your
network. </p>
        <p>The third advantage is that using a Windows Device often provides a useful
way around compatibility problems that may occur when Perky Duck is attempting
to write to the port directly. These errors are called WriteComm failed errors</p>
        <p>To set up a Windows Device for Perky Duck to use, you may need to have your
Windows Operating System diskettes or CD-ROM ready. If you are familiar with
adding a printer, then you should install a "Generic/Text Only"
printer on the port to which your braille embosser is or will be connected.</p>
        <p>If you are not familiar with this process, you can follow the directions in
Setting up a Windows Device in <a href="..\..\POPUPS\Setting_up_a_Windows_Device_in_Windows.htm">Setting
up a Windows Device in Windows</a>. </p>
