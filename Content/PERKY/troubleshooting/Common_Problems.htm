        <h2>Common Problems</h2>
        <h5><a name="kanchor645"></a><a name="kanchor646"></a><a name="kanchor647"></a>Braille
Printers. </h5>
        <p><a name="kanchor648"></a><a name="kanchor649"></a><a name="kanchor650"></a><b>Q:
I've just got a new PC, and installed my Braille Embosser and Perky Duck onto
it. Now I'm getting "rubbish" Braille being printed.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p><a name="kanchor651"></a><a name="kanchor652"></a>A1: In most cases, this is due
to the Parallel Port setting in the computer's BIOS not being set to SPP or
Standard Parallel Port. However, the most recent models of Index embossers
(i.e. those with USB &amp; Network ports) require ECP/EPP. Contact a local
technician if you are not sure about altering the BIOS..</p>
        <p>A1: If running the embosser through a Serial connection, make sure that you
have the correct cable, and that the settings on the PC and Printer, such as
Baud rate, Stop Bits, etc., are the same on both.</p>
        <p><b>Q: My Braille embosser was working fine until I installed a new ink
printer. Now I'm getting "rubbish" Braille.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p><b>or</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p><b>Q: My Braille embosser was working fine until I installed a new ink
printer. Now my braille embosser won't work at all.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p><a name="kanchor653"></a><a name="kanchor654"></a><a name="kanchor655"></a><a name="kanchor656"></a><a name="kanchor657"></a><a name="kanchor658"></a>A: The chances
are that you have set-up Perky Duck in Global/Embosser Setup to print direct to
a printer port such as LPT1. In Windows, go to Settings, Printers, and Add New
Printer. Under Printer Manufacturers select "Generic", and under Type,
select Text Only. Now run Perky Duck, go to the Global menu, then Embosser
Setup, and under Windows devices, select the Generic/Text Only printer which
you have just installed. </p>
        <p><b>Q: I've an Index Basic Braille embosser, and suddenly all the text is no
longer formatted as it appears in Perky Duck.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>A: Someone has switched the printers format switch to the "REF" or
Reformat Position. There are four switches on the top left of the printer. Make
sure the switch second from the left is pressed down at the front.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor659"></a><a name="kanchor660"></a><b>Q: My printer is missing
dots, cells, or groups of cells. (Or generally, "acting up").</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>A: It may be that the printer itself is faulty. Refer to the manual for the
printer, and perform a "Test Print" or "Self Test". If the
problem exists with this test, then it is almost certainly the printer which is
at fault.</p>
        <p><b>Q: Sometimes my embosser decides to print rubbish at random intervals.</b>
        </p>
        <p>A: This can be due to using an excessively long Parallel cable, or one of
dubious quality. Use a shorter cable (ideally no longer than 10 feet or 3
Meters) or replace it.</p>
        <h5><a name="kanchor661"></a>Printer Drivers.</h5>
        <p><a name="kanchor662"></a><b>Q: I don't have any Windows Drivers for my Braille
printer</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>A: In general there are no such drivers. Install a Generic/Text Only
printer. In Perky Duck's Global - Embosser Setup, under Windows Device, set to
this printer.</p>
        <p>An exception to this are some Index printers which were introduced at the
end of 2002. Please contact your local supplier for further information.</p>
        <h5><a name="kanchor663"></a>Formatting Problems.</h5>
        <p><b>Q: My Double-sided printer is only printing Single-sided.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p><b>Or</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p><b>Q: I'm getting unwanted blank lines or blank pages.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>A: This is usually because of a difference between your printer's settings
and Perky Duck's. For example, Perky Duck set to 29 characters per line, and
the printer set to 28. As a general rule, always set Perky Duck's Line and Page
Length to one less than the printer is set to.</p>
        <h5><a name="kanchor664"></a>Missing Text.</h5>
        <p><b>Q: I have a very large document, and am unable to print it out without
large chunks of text going missing.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p><a name="kanchor665"></a>A: This is usually caused either by your Braille
Printer not having sufficient "Buffer memory", or not
"Handshaking" correctly with your computer. The Braille printer
manufacturer may be able to advise you on whether you can solve the problem
locally, or perhaps if you require a printer firmware upgrade. Alternatively,
try printing the document in smaller sections. (As a VERY rough guide, if your
printer has say 100k of Buffer Memory, you should get away with sending about
80 to 90 pages at a time.)</p>
        <h5><a name="kanchor666"></a>6-Key Entry</h5>
        <p><b>Q: All of the dots I type in Perky Duck do not appear on the screen.</b>
        </p>
        <p><a name="kanchor667"></a>A: This indicates that your keyboard does not have
6-key chording. To do six-key entry you will need to replace the keyboard with
one that does support 6-key chording. You can test a keyboard by opening
Notepad and typing the 6 keys (normally s, d, f, j, k and l) all at once. If
all six letters appear each time you type them all (the order doesn’t matter as
long as all six letters appear), then the keyboard will support 6-key entry. If
any letters are missing, then the keyboard cannot be used with Perky Duck and
will need to be replaced with one that will support 6-key chording.</p>
