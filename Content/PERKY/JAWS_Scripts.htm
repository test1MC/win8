        <h2>JAWS Scripts</h2>
        <p>Perky Duck comes with JAWS script files which support JAWS 4.0 or higher. <i>(Please&#160;note
that these are for English only.</i>) </p>
        <p>When you launch Perky Duck, a special utility checks to see if your JAWS
settings folders have up-to-date copies of the JAWS script files for Perky Duck.
&#160;If not, it asks for permission to install the script files supplied with
Perky Duck. &#160;If you answer yes, it installs them and also makes back-up
copies of any files it is replacing.</p>
        <h5>Hot keys:</h5>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><span class="keyboard">Insert</span>

        <h3>Important tip:</h3>
        <p>If you get garbled speech when you select text with the shift key in Perky
Duck, go to DBT's Global: <a href="the_menus/menu_global/Global_View_Preferences....htm">View
Preferences...</a> dialog, and set "SHOW CURSOR LOCATOR WHEN SHIFT IS
PUSHED" to no.</p>
        <h3>Other features</h3>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><a name="kanchor16"></a>When you
 move over a skipped line other than a blank paragraph, with an arrow key
 command or in a SayAll command, the PC speaker beeps. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>When you are editing a document
 and you move with the left or right arrow key, you hear the "braille
 cell" spoken, rather than hearing the ASCII character (for example in
 English, you might hear "e d sign" rather than "dollar
 sign"). </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>The above type of keyboard echo
 is also available for keyboard entry in a braille document, be it 6-key entry
 or not; you can choose this with a toggle. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>When you use a movement command
 but the cursor does not move, JAWS tells you that you are in the same
 spot. &#160;An example is landing on the same character when you use the
 left or right arrow key in formatted view, because there is an adjacent
 code (in coded view). </li>
        </ul>
