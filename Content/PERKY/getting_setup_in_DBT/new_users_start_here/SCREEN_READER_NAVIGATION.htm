        <h3><a name="CONTENTS"></a>Using The Table of Contents (Alt + c)</h3>
        <p>When you first open the Perky Duck help system, the Table of Contents is
displayed on the left side of a split window. The Table of Contents lists a
number of books and pages. Books are categories containing a number of pages.
The pages are topics containing information. <span class="keyboard">Up Arrow</span>
and <span class="keyboard">Down Arrow</span> are used to move through the Table
of Contents. <span class="keyboard">Right Arrow</span> is used to open a book. <span class="keyboard">Left Arrow</span> is used to close a book. Press <span class="keyboard">Enter</span> on a selected page to access the text of that
topic, and then press <span class="keyboard">F6</span> to move to the topic
window. Press <span class="keyboard">F6</span> to return to the Table of
Contents, or press <span class="keyboard">Alt + c</span> to return to the Table
of Contents from any section of the help system.</p>
        <h3><a name="INDEX"></a>Using the Index (Alt + n)</h3>
        <p>Press <span class="keyboard">Alt + n</span> to move to the Index. Type in
keywords to locate related topics. Keywords are help related terms or concepts.
After typing in a keyword, press <span class="keyboard">Up Arrow</span> or <span class="keyboard">Down Arrow</span> to move through a list of matching index
entries. Press <span class="keyboard">Enter</span> to select a keyword. If there
is only one matching topic, it is displayed in the topic window. Press <span class="keyboard">F6</span> to move to the topic window. If there are multiple
matching topics, they are displayed in a list. Select a topic from the list,
press <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>, then press <span class="keyboard">F6</span>
to move to the topic window.</p>
        <h3><a name="SEARCH"></a>Using Search (Alt + s)</h3>
        <p>Press <span class="keyboard">Alt + s</span> to move to the Search page. Type
in the word or phrase you are looking for, and then press <span class="keyboard">Tab</span>
to move to the List Topics Button. Press <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>, and
then press <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> to move to the list of topics.</p>
        <p>Use the arrow keys to locate topics and press <span class="keyboard">Enter</span>
to open them. Press <span class="keyboard">F6</span> to move to the topic window.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> Search follows much the same rules as searching in Internet
Explorer. &#160;If you type in a single word, it will normally find all topics
containing that word. &#160;For example if you typed in the word <span class="code-duxscreen">font</span>, it would find many, many Topics containing
that word. &#160;However, if you typed in <span class="code-duxscreen">braille
font</span>, do not be surprised to find many more additional topics, since
this would final all occurrences in topics of the word <b>braille</b><b>OR</b>
the word <b>font</b>. &#160;To narrow the search down, type the expression
inside double quotes, i.e. <span class="code-duxscreen">"braille font"</span>.
&#160;This will then only find Topics where the words, "braille font"
appear as you have typed them.</p>
        <h3><a name="GLOSSARY"></a>Using the Glossary (Alt + g)</h3>
        <p>Press <span class="keyboard">Alt + g</span> to move to the Glossary. Focus is
initially in a list of Terms. Type the first few characters of the term for
which you are looking and/or Arrow through the list of terms. Once you have
located the desired term, press <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> to move to the
definition for that term. Press <span class="keyboard">Insert + Down Arrow</span>
to read the definition. Other JAWS reading commands can also be used. Press <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> again to return to the list of terms.</p>
        <h3><a name="FAVOURITES"></a>Using Favorites (Alt + i)</h3>
        <p>Press <span class="keyboard">Alt + i</span> to move to Favorites. Focus is
initially on the list of Favorite Topics, however, when you first use
Favorites, there will be none listed. Normally, you can arrow up and down the
list to one of your choice. Press <span class="keyboard">Alt + d</span> to
display contents of the topic. Then press <span class="keyboard">F6</span> to
move focus to the right hand window where the explanation is displayed.</p>
        <p>If you press <span class="keyboard">Alt + u</span> you will arrive at a Text
Box called "Current Topic". This normally displays the Topic you are
currently focused on. If you would like to add this topic to your list of
Favorites, type <span class="keyboard">Alt + a</span>.</p>
        <p>If you decide you no longer wish an item to appear in your list, move to the
item as described above, and press <span class="keyboard">Alt + r</span>.</p>
        <h3><a name="TOPICPANE"></a>Reading the Topic Pane </h3>
        <p>To select a topic from the table of contents and move to the topic pane to
read more, press <span class="keyboard">Enter</span> and then <span class="keyboard">F6</span>.</p>
        <p>When reading the topic pane, you can use the keyboard commands that apply in
your browser. Some examples are: the JAWS Continuous read command <span class="keyboard">Insert + Down Arrow</span>; <span class="keyboard">Alt + Left
Arrow</span> to move back to a previous topic where applicable; <span class="keyboard">Tab</span> or <span class="keyboard">Shift + Tab</span> to move to
a link.</p>
        <p><span class="keyboard">JawsKey </span>+<span class="keyboard"> F6</span> for the
list of headings in the topic; <span class="keyboard">JawsKey </span>+<span class="keyboard"> F7</span> for the list of links in the topic. &#160;You can also
use the JAWS Find commands to find specific text in the topic. &#160;These
commands are <span class="keyboard">JawsKey </span>+<span class="keyboard"> Shift </span>+<span class="keyboard"> F</span>, and<span class="keyboard"> F3</span> and<span class="keyboard"> Shift + F3</span> to find further occurrences.</p>
        <p>Use <span class="keyboard">F6</span> to switch back to the left pane.
&#160;If, while reading a topic, you decide that you want to add it to your
favorite topics list, simply press <span class="keyboard">Alt + i</span>, <span class="keyboard">Alt + a</span>, and <span class="keyboard">F6</span>. &#160;This
quick sequence brings up the favorites list, adds the current topic, and
returns you to the reading pane. &#160;Navigating back to the topic will be
much quicker in the future.</p>
