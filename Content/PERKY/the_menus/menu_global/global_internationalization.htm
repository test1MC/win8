        <p>Subject to availability, you may now select a different language interface
within Perky Duck. Therefoer if you select Dansk for example, all your menus
and dialogs will appear in Danish.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor315"></a>In some instances, you may need to perform additional
tasks in order to set up Duxbury for your own country/locale. You local dealer
is best placed to advise you on any necessary requirements here.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor316"></a>Should you change the Braille code for display, you
will need to restart Perky Duck for the change to take effect. You will also
receive the following warning dialog.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" src="menu_global_internationalization_warning_413x126.jpg" alt="Image shows a warning screen which comes up to inform you that if you have changed &quot;Braille Code for Display&quot;, the display will be incorrect until DBT is restarted," />
        </p>
        <p>We do also recommend you study <a href="global_menu_perky.htm">The
Menus, Global</a> section in full.</p>

now - it could save you an anxious telephone call!</span></b>
        </p>
        <p>If you come in to school one day, to find one of your clever students has
played a trick on you, and changed language, don't panic. Click on the last but
one menu item towards the right at the top of the screen. This should bring up
what is effectively the Global menu. Go down to the fifth item, and click on
it. The Internationalization dialog will come up, and hopefully you will be
able to select your own language.</p>
