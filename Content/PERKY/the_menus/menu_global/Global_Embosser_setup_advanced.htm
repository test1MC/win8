        <h3>Global: Embosser Setup: Advanced.</h3>
        <p>When you select "Advanced" from the Tri-pane window, the following
dialog will appear.</p>
        <p><b>WARNING: Do not make any changes to this dialog unless you know precisely
what you are doing!</b>
        </p>
        <p>With the vast majority of Brailler Devices, you will not require to make any
changes to this dialog unless specifically advised by either Duxbury Systems
Inc. or your embosser manufacturer.</p>
        <p>However if you are faced with a device which is unlisted or unknown to Perky
Duck, you may find this useful in some areas.</p>

        <p><b>Job Setup</b> - checking the "Use custom job setup" check box
allows you to enable "Job start codes" and "Job end codes",
described below.</p>
        <p><b>Job start codes:</b> Text that you type here will be sent to the embosser
<i>after</i> any setup sequence (e.g. escape codes) that Perky Duck normally
sends when starting to emboss. The additional text that you add to the setup
sequence may be used for any purpose. However, it is best to avoid using this
feature to redefine the form length, the braille cell size, or the interline
spacing of the braille. Any change to these characteristics will not be
recognized by Perky Duck, and so Perky Duck will not create a document properly
formatted for the page. Text that you type here may be any printable ASCII
character (including space, but excluding less-than and greater-than), or any
of the following special sequences: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>&lt;esc&gt; Escape (ASCII 27) </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>&lt;lf&gt; Line Feed (ASCII 10)
     </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>&lt;ff&gt; Form Feed (ASCII 12)
     </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>&lt;cr&gt; Carriage Return
 (ASCII 13) </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>&lt;ctrl-@&gt; NUL (ASCII 0) </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><span lang="ES-CO">&lt;ctrl-A&gt;
 Control-A (ASCII 1)<br />     ... </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><span lang="ES-CO">&lt;ctrl-Z&gt;
 Control-Z (ASCII 26) </span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>&lt;lt&gt; Less-than (ASCII 60)
     </li>
        </ul>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>&lt;gt&gt; Greater-than (ASCII
 62) </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Job end codes:</b> Text that you type here will be sent to the embosser <i>before</i>
any job-ending sequence (e.g. escape codes) that Perky Duck sends on its own.
Text may contain the same ASCII printable characters and special sequences as
are defined for Job start codes. Job end codes are often left blank even when
Job start codes are used.</p>
        <p>A user of the Gemini embosser might enter &lt;esc&gt;&lt;esc&gt;Q to enable
double-sized interline print and/or &lt;esc&gt;&lt;esc&gt;D to enable
double-striking of the braille. Note that neither of these changes affects the
form size or the layout of the braille on the form.</p>
        <div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <hr size="1" width="50%" align="center" />
        </div>
        <p><b>End of line and page</b> - These options control what device Control
Codes are produced at the ends of lines and pages.</p>
        <p><b>End of line indicator:</b> Normally Perky Duck will send a CR/LF Control
Code at the end of each line. However, if you have opted to <a href="Global_Embosser_setup_general.htm#write_to_file">Write
to file</a>, with a view to processing that file on a non-Windows or non-Perky
Duck system, you may make an appropriate selection here.</p>
        <p><b>End of page indicator:</b> As with End of line indicators, you may wish
to select a more suitable option here.</p>
        <p><b>EOL on a full line:</b> Check this box if you wish to add an End of Line
Code even when the line contains as many braille cells as the embosser will
support. Many embossers automatically skip to the beginning of the next line in
this circumstance, so it can be important to leave this option un-checked.</p>
        <p><b>EOP on a full page:</b> Check this box if you wish to add an End of Page
Code even when all possible lines contain braille. Many embossers automatically
skip to the top of the next page in this circumstance, so it can be important
to leave this option un-checked.</p>
        <p><b>Pad lines:</b> Some devices need to see at least a few characters on each
line. Checking this box will therefore cause spaces to be added at the end of
any lines that are blank or very short. </p>
        <p><b>Prompt for new sheet:</b> Checking this box causes Perky Duck to pause
after each page has been sent to the Braille Device. This can be useful if for
any reason you have to feed each page of material manually into the device.</p>
        <div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <hr size="1" width="50%" align="center" />
        </div>
        <p><b>Timing:</b> This is a highly technical area, but basically it controls
how long Perky Duck waits after sending a text character or control character.
It is enabled only when "Write to Port" is selected in the <a href="..\..\the_menus\MENU_GLOBAL\Global_Embosser_setup_general.htm">General
tab</a>. Perky Duck normally maintains Timing values as is appropriate for the
device and port you select; you should only change these values if you are
having extreme difficulty interfacing a device.</p>
