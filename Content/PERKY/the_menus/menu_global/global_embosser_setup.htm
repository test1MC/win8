        <h2>Global: Embosser Setup...</h2>
        <p class="keystroke">Keyboard: <span class="keyboard">e</span> from Global menu.</p>
        <p><b>This module is purely to enable you to set up one or more embossers on
your system, and to allow you to specify a default embosser for <u>all new
documents.</u> If you wish to change the embosser or its settings <u>for an
individual document</u>, (new or existing) you MUST do this in </b><a href="..\..\the_menus\menu_document\document_embosser_setup.htm"><b>Document:
Embosser Setup</b></a><b>.</b>
        </p>
        <p>The <b>Global: Embosser Setup</b> dialog is used to tell Perky Duck about
your braille embosser. You must normally have at least one embosser (Brailler
Device) set up on your system, but you may now have as many devices as you
like. See <a href="#additional_notes">Additional
Notes</a> at the end of this topic for more information.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Brailler Device:</b> (Selection/List box) During the Perky Duck
installation process, you may have chosen to install one or more embossers. If
so, they will appear in this list. If the list only contains "(No Target
Embosser)", and you wish to set one up, tab to the "New" button,
and press Enter.</p>
        <p><b>New:</b> This button will take you to the Embosser Setup: <a href="..\..\the_menus\MENU_GLOBAL\Global_Embosser_setup_general.htm">General</a>
Tab, which is one of three tabs where you may begin the setup process. (If you
are setting up a new embosser, may we suggest you click on the above link now.)</p>
        <p><b>** Modify Embosser:</b> Before you click this button, please ensure that
you have highlighted the embosser you wish to edit in the Braille Device
selection list. This button will also take you to the <a href="..\..\the_menus\MENU_GLOBAL\Global_Embosser_setup_general.htm">Embosser
Setup: General</a> Tab.</p>
        <p><b>** Remove:</b> If you wish to remove an Embosser Device, please ensure it
is highlighted in the Brailler Device list first, before pressing the
"Remove" button. [Note: You cannot remove the "(No Target
Embosser)" entry. ] You will be asked to confirm that you wish to remove
the selected embosser as shown below. Press the "Yes" or
"No" button as appropriate.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you remove any Brailler Device, Perky Duck sets the Brailler
Device to "(No Target Embosser)". In such circumstances, you will
only have the Characters per line and Lines per page options available. </p>
        <p>There are however limitations in so much as you may only select between 10
and 160 Characters per line, and between 4 and 40 Lines per page.</p>

        <p><b><i>(** The "Modify Embosser" and "Remove" buttons
will be disabled if a user will be unable to save changes to the configuration.
So, restricted users in Windows XP will find that these buttons will often be
disabled. In Vista, they will often be disabled if a user has not run DBT
"As Administrator".)</i></b>

        <p><b>Desired Braille Document Formatting</b> - This section contains 8
controls. However, it is important to appreciate that entries here may be
constrained by settings in the Global: Embosser Setup - <a href="..\..\the_menus\MENU_GLOBAL\Global_Embosser_setup_settings.htm">Device
Settings</a> tab. For example, if you have set up a Top Margin of 2 in Device
Settings, you cannot have a Top Margin of less than 2 in this section.</p>
        <p><b>Characters per line:</b> Enter your desired characters per line,
excluding the binding margin.</p>
        <p><b>Lines per page:</b> Enter your desired lines per page, excluding the top
margin.</p>
        <p><b>Top margin in Lines:</b> Enter your desired top margin in lines.</p>
        <p><b>Binding margin in characters:</b> Enter your desired margin in
characters.</p>
        <p>Now we have three check boxes which may or may not be grayed out.
Availability of these items is controlled by capabilities of your selected
embosser.</p>
        <p><b>Emboss in Interpoint:</b> This will only be available if your embosser
supports Interpoint (or double-sided) embossing.</p>
        <p><b>Banner Page:</b> This is an additional page which is embossed at the
beginning of each file your emboss giving basic file information.</p>

        <p>If you are satisfied with your changes, press the <span class="keyboard">OK</span>
