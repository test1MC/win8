        <p>This is a simple dialog which controls four viewing elements.</p>
        <p><b>Margin bell position:</b><a name="kanchor318"></a> This feature is ONLY
available when using 6 key entry with a braille file. This feature is much the
same as the bell on a Perkins brailler, and indeed you will hear an actual
Perkins bell sound though your computer's sound card. (Assuming you have one)</p>
        <p>In the illustration above, the sound will be emitted when you reach the 5th
last cell on the line. To turn the feature off, enter a position of zero.</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor319"></a><b>Show Cursor Locator</b> - This provides a means of
showing where the cursor is located by displaying a series of rings round the
location of the cursor, and can be very useful when editing documents.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;">
            <img border="0" width="661" height="166" src="menu_global_cursor_locator.jpg" alt="Image showing cursor locator function." /><a name="Cursor_Locator"></a>
        </p>
        <p>Three check boxes give you options of when the cursor locator will be
displayed:</p>
        <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><b>When a document is opened.</b>
     (Remember that the last cursor location is stored with all saved
 documents.) </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><a name="kanchor320"></a><b>When
 Switching views. </b>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li><b>When the <span class="keyboard">Shift</span> key is pressed. </b>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you do not wish to see the Cursor locater at all, simply uncheck all
three boxes.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b><a name="kanchor321"></a> Some communication software such as
Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection, requires that special cursors be turned
off.</p>
        <p><b>Six-key Key Set:</b><a name="kanchor322"></a> You can use what is called
"Six-key Entry" to input braille direct into Perky Duck documents.
This is a facility which can be very useful when you require a specific
permutation of dots. Checking this box will enable the use of the <span class="keyboard">fds</span> and <span class="keyboard">jkl</span> keys to represent
dots 123 and 456 respectively.</p>
        <p>However, if these keys are not suitable, or perhaps do not work on your
keyboard, you may select a different combination here.</p>
        <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Not all PC keyboards will support Six-Key Entry.
However, some will allow you to use alternatives such as <span class="keyboard">ewq</span>
and <span class="keyboard">op[ </span></p>
        <p><i>Unfortunately there is no magic solution for keyboards which do not
support Six-key Entry. However generally speaking, keyboards at the lowest end
of the price range are most likely to work.</i>

        <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>If you wish to play a different
 sound, you can replace the "margin.wav" file found in the
 duxbury program folder (normally c:\Program Files\Duxbury\<span class="primaryversionfolder">Perky Duck 11.1</span>). It will play your wave
 file instead. You can use <u>any</u> existing wave file of your choosing,
 but note that you MUST rename the file to margin.wav. </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li>You may wish to adjust the
 volume of the bell, especially if using a screen reader. This can be done
 through Windows Sound Recorder. (All Programs, Accessories, Entertainment,
 Sound Recorder) Open the margin.wav file, then select Increase or Decrease
 Volume from the Effects menu. </li>
        </ol>
