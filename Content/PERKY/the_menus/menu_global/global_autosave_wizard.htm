        <h3><a name="kanchor313"></a>Global: DBT Autosave Recovery Wizard:</h3>
        <p>Should your system fail for any reason while using Perky Duck, next time you
run this program, you will normally see the Recovery Wizard screen appear. This
gives you the option to recover any document(s) you had open, but had not saved
during your last Perky Duck session.</p>
        <p>Please note that if you open a document, and do not make any changes, it
will not be listed.</p>
        <p>The DBT Autosave recovery Wizard dialog will appear next, showing a list of
the files which have been autosaved. You have a choice of three buttons
explained below. Note that focus will normally be on the "Open"
button.</p>
