        <h1>Using Perky Duck</h1>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Perky Duck is designed to work in the same way the Perkins
Brailler braille typewriter works by using six keys on your keyboard and the
space bar. It is designed for use by students learning to type braille by hand
for the purpose of certification in braille transcription.</p>
        <h2>Typing a Braille Character</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>The braille cell consists of six dots: three on the left
which are dots 1, 2 and 3 (starting from the top) and three on the right which
are dots 4, 5 and 6 (starting from the top). See the topic The Basics of
Braille. You can type any braille cell configuration in Perky Duck by
simultaneously typing keys on your keyboard to correspond to the dots you want
to appear in the cell. The keys you would normally use are F (dot 1), D (dot
2), S (dot 3), J (dot 4), K (dot 5) and L (dot 6). The space bar skips a cell
and leaves a blank space.</p>
        <p>For example if you want to type a braille letter A, which is
a dot 1 with the other five dots left blank, you would type the F key. To
create a “for” sign, which is all six dots, you would type the F, D, S, J, K
and L keys all at once.&#160; See Troubleshooting if you find that dots are
frequently missing from braille cells.</p>
        <h2>Formatting in Perky Duck</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Like a braille typewriter, Perky Duck does not have any
automated formatting features, such as the ability to tab, center words or
right justify text. These tasks are accomplished manually. Your braille
instructor will explain how to do this.</p>
        <p>Perky Duck does have a word wrap feature and an adjustable
warning bell to tell you when you are nearing the end of a line.</p>
