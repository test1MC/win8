        <h2><a name="kanchor291"></a>Document: Printer Setup...</h2>
        <p class="keystroke">Keystroke: <span class="keyboard">Ctrl + F12</span></p>
        <p>When you select this option, the following dialog will be displayed.</p>
        <p>Before making adjustments, be aware that there are two likely situations
where you may want to "print" a document. (As opposed to embossing it)</p>
        <p><a name="kanchor122"></a><a name="kanchor123"></a>The first is to obtain a copy
of your text document, and the second to obtain a print copy of your braille
document. In the case of the latter, (often used by sighted braille proof
readers) you need to take special care when setting up the Formatted Page Size.</p>
        <p align="center" style="text-align: center;"><b><img border="0" src="menu_document_embosser_setup.jpg" alt="Image shows the Printer Setup dialog." /></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>Printer...:</b> (Button or press <span class="keyboard">Alt + p</span>)</p>
        <p>It may seem odd to start at the end of the dialog, but in fact we do need to
select an ink printer before we can make appropriate changes to the main
dialog. This will bring up another dialog (not shown here), enabling us to
select a printer which is already installed on the system. From the Name: drop
down list box, select the printer you wish you use for all printing.</p>
        <p><b>Properties:</b> (Button) This will bring up yet another dialog which
shows the Properties for the selected printer. This will be a dialog
appropriate for the printer selected, and as these vary considerably, we
suggest you may wish to refer to your printer manual for a detailed
explanation.</p>
        <p><b>Network:</b> (Button) If the printer you wish to use is on a Network,
this will bring up the standard Windows Network Printer dialog appropriate to
your operating system. If you are unsure about this function, please refer to
your system manager or administrator.</p>
        <p>When you have selected your
printer, press OK to return to the main Global: Printer Setup dialog and
proceed as follows:</p>
        <h5>Paper</h5>
        <p><b>Size:</b> This is a drop
down list box which enables you to select the size of paper to be used for
printed output. The list of sizes available in determined by the make &amp;
model of printer selected.</p>
        <p><b>Source:</b> Some printers
allow you to feed paper in a variety of ways. Some also have multiple paper
trays to enable you to select different types and colour of paper. Again, what
is available is dependent on the make &amp; model of printer selected.</p>
        <h5>Orientation</h5>
        <p><a name="kanchor124"></a><a name="kanchor125"></a>Radio Buttons - Portrait or Landscape.</p>
        <h5>Margins</h5>
        <p>This allows you to enter
Left, Right, Top and Bottom margins.</p>
        <h5>Formatted Page Size</h5>
        <p>You may enter Lines per page
and Characters per line here. However - please note the following:</p>
        <ol start="1" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;margin-bottom: .0001pt;line-height: normal;"><a name="kanchor126"></a><b>Perky Duck uses whatever font and point
 size you have selected in the </b><a href="..\..\the_menus\MENU_GLOBAL\Global_Fonts.htm"><b>Global:
 Fonts</b></a><a name="kanchor127"></a><b> option for its printed output. You
 may therefore have to experiment to ensure that your output fits the
 selected paper size. For example, with 22 point Braille or SimBraille
 font, you will only get around 25-26 lines per page, and 30 - 32
 characters per line. </b>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
            <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;margin-bottom: .0001pt;line-height: normal;"><b>These settings will be ignored if you have checked
 "Auto-determine point size for printed output" in the </b><a href="..\..\the_menus\MENU_GLOBAL\Global_Fonts.htm"><b>Global:
 Fonts</b></a><b> option.</b> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>

button.</p>
