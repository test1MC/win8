        <h1>Use Transcriber Preferences</h1>
        <p>"<span class="Code-DuxCode">utp</span>" stands for "use transcriber preference". When a transcriber wants to avoid the possibility of an extended g1 indicator being used on expressions that are not all that complex nor extensive, the code <span class="Code-DuxCode">[utp2]</span> could be used to ensure that result. If that code is used at the beginning of a file, no extended grade 1 indicators would be used throughout. Alternatively, the pair</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[utp2]</span>... <span class="Code-DuxCode">[utp]</span></p>
        <p>(perhaps implemented via a style) could be used just around those expressions where that kind of control is desired, leaving DBT's normal logic to handle most cases.</p>
