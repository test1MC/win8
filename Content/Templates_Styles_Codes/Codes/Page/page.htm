        <p class="Normal">There are for example occasions for example, where if there are only a few lines left on a page to fit a new text Heading, you specifically would not want that Heading to appear on the last line of a page, with the next paragraph beginning on the next page. You might not even wish just one or two lines of the next paragraph to follow the Heading on the same page, but to start both Heading and paragraph on a new page.</p>
        <p class="Normal">Many print books are also written in such a way that Chapters begin on an odd (right hand) or even (left hand) page. The same may also apply in braille publications.</p>
        <p class="Normal">Remember too that there are also occasions where in braille, as in print, you would begin on an even page after the Title page - a Table of Contents would never normally appear on the back of the Title page.</p>
