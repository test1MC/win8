            <MadCap:keyword term="Poetry" />Poetry</h4>
        <p>This topic is essentially for those who have experience of both DBT Codes and braille poetry layout according to BANA rules.</p>
        <p>It has been a late addition to this version of DBT, and to fully understand the concept, you should refer to <a href="../../working_with_word/BANA_Template_2014/Word_Template_BANA_Braille_2014.htm">Working with Word: Word Template (BANA Braille 2014)</a> or more specifically the <a href="../../working_with_word/BANA_Template_2014/Word_Template_BANA_Braille_2014.htm#Poetry">Poetry</a> section.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode"><MadCap:keyword term="linenum" />[linenum]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenumC:A]</span> -- Handle the next word as a line number for line-numbered poetry or prose.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> treats next word from the document for use as a line number, and may cause a line break in the text. If a line number comprises more than one word, then the words may be grouped using <span class="Code-DuxCode">[:]</span> and<span class="Code-DuxCode"> [;]</span>, e.g.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum][:]</span><span class="Code-DuxScreen">48 B</span><span class="Code-DuxCode">[;]</span>
        </p>
        <p>Ordinarily, <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> will cause the word that is to be treated as a line number to be placed on the right margin, adjusting the right margin automatically as necessary, without otherwise interfering with text flow.</p>
        <p>If, since the last forced line break, there has been text in the document (i.e. if the line number comes in the middle or at the end of a "paragraph") then <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> implies <span class="Code-DuxCode">[pm3:3]</span>, which can result in a line break, so that the line number itself and the text following it will be placed on the next line. This is intended to avoid having two line numbers occupy the same physical space in the braille layout, without requiring the transcriber to plan ahead. A right margin set implicitly by <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> will override any later attempt on the page to reduce the right margin using <span class="Code-DuxCode">[rm]</span>, unless two parameters are given to the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[rm]</span> code.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> will ordinarily adjust the right margin to leave room for the widest line number on the page (counting only line numbers set with <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> itself, plus two spaces. <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> "looks ahead" in this respect, when determining how to set the right margin. The right margin set by <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> is ordinarily reset at the end of each page. However, it can be reset earlier, to separate a page into different sections for line-numbering margin computations, or carried across a page boundary, by using the "override margin" feature of <span class="Code-DuxCode">[rm]</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> is unique among DBT codes in that it does not intefere with pending effects of other codes. So, if <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> and a line number appear after a <span class="Code-DuxCode">[tab]</span> code, but before the word to be placed at a tabstop, the tabstop placement will be correct even so.</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> can take two optional parameters. The first specifies a column for alignment purposes. Here, <span class="Code-DuxCode">-1</span> can be used to specify the rightmost cell on the page. The second parameter, if specified, should be <span class="Code-DuxCode">l</span>, <span class="Code-DuxCode">r</span>, or <span class="Code-DuxCode">c</span>, to specify left, right, or center alignment on this cell. Note that the paramters control where the line number will be placed. They do no affect other text on the line. Without any parameters, <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> is equivalent to <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum-1:r]</span>. <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> will not have any effect on any margins unless the parameters are in fact <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum-1:r]</span> or, equivalently, <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum]</span> or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[linenum-1]</span>.</p>
