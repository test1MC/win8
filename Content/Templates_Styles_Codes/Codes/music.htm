            <MadCap:keyword term="GOODFEEL®" />However, in order to use this feature, you must have a licensed version of the GOODFEEL® braille music software from: <br />Dancing Dots <br />1754 Quarry Lane <br />P.O. Box 927, <br />Valley Forge, PA 19482-0927. <br />Telephone: +1-610-783-6692 <br />Fax: +1-610-783-6732. <br /></p>

        <p>Provided GOODFEEL® Version 3 is installed on the same machine as DBT, you normally do not require to do any special setting up for the function to work.</p>
        <p>To place a braille music file in your text document, first position the cursor in the precise position you wish the music to be inserted.</p>
        <p>Go to the Edit menu, and select "Insert File". This will open up the normal Windows Insert File dialog.</p>
        <p>Navigate to the folder containing your music file, highlight the file you require, and press <u><b>O</b></u>pen.</p>
        <p>If you are in Normal view, you will see a braille text view of your music. Please note that you CANNOT edit this section of your document.</p>
        <p>In Coded view, you will see something similar to the following.</p>
        <p align="center" class="center">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/codes_styles_templates/Music_Coded_View.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 124px;" width="350" height="124" border="1" alt="Image shows how Codes for inserted music file appears in pre-translated document." />
        </p>
        <p>In the above example, is a Lime file called, "Stage Band (In C) 2_4.lim".</p>
        <p>The <span class="Code-DuxScreen">0</span> above is a sequential number give to each imported music file in your document.</p>
        <p>The file name is shown for reference purposes only. (DBT Adds underbars in place of blank spaces in this part of the Code parameter)</p>
        <p>When you Translate the document, the braille will contain the music you have inserted.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE 2:</b> DBT has absolutely no control over the translation and formatting of the braille music. This is entirely controlled by the GOODFEEL® translation process.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE 3:</b> We suggest turning off running headers, running footers, and page numbering where music is inserted to avoid possible conficts with GOODFEEL's page numbering.</p>
        <p><b>NOTE 4:</b> The music file is embedded in the DBT document, so you can send the .DXP file or .DXB file <b>alone</b> to another transcriber (without the .lim or ,mid file). The other transcriber must of course have GOODFEEL and DBT also.</p>
