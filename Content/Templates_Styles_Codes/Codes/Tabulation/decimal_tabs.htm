        <p><span class="hcp1">Note:</span> Please do not be put off by the term "Decimal"! In DBT, this Code can be used in a variety of ways to align text or numbers. A term we might perhaps call "Designated Character Alignment"</p>
        <p><b>Also known as:</b> Decimal Alignment</p>
        <p><span class="hcp1">What you might need to know first:</span> It might help to study the <a href="..\dollar_codes_quick_reference.htm#NOTES_GENERAL">Notes on General Code Syntax</a>.</p>
        <p>Codes Used: <span class="Code-DuxCode">[ifbrl]</span> and/or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[ifprt]</span> and <span class="Code-DuxCode">[svdac~x]</span></p>
        <p class="Keystroke">Keystroke: (None at present)</p>
        <p class="bold">What does it do?</p>
        <p>It allows you to specify what character is to be used to align numbers or even text.</p>
        <p class="bold">Where would it be used?</p>
        <p>Many countries write numbers with commas separating the thousands, and a period or full stop as the decimal point. For example: <span class="Code-DuxScreen">7,134.56</span></p>
        <p>However, in much of Europe (Not in the U.K.) the format is reversed, and therefore in the above example, it would be written as <span class="Code-DuxScreen">7.124,56</span></p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> <i>This would be an ideal code to include in the initial style of a Template.</i></p>
        <p class="bold">For the more technical:</p>
        <p><span class="Code-DuxCode">[svdac~X]</span> -- Set decimal alignment character to <span class="Code-DuxCode">X</span>. This sets the character that is used by the tab commands to control decimal alignment. The default is the character that is common for American usage, i.e. presently <span class="Code-DuxCode">[svdac~.]</span> for both print and braille files (= dots 4-6 in the latter).</p>
