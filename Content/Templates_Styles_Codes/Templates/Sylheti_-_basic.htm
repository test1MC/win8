        <p>You are seeing this page since the DBT Template you selected is <b>Sylheti - basic</b>.</p>
        <p>When you open (import) a file into Duxbury DBT, you have an opportunity to select a DBT Template. If you select a default Template, then you do not have to select a Template each time you open a file. Once you highlight the name of a DBT Template, you can click on the button that says <b>Select Template as Default</b>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>This is a basic DBT Template. <a href="basic.htm">Click here for more information about Basic Templates</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>This DBT Template is designed to produce material written in the <b>Sylheti</b> language.</p>
        <p>If the text you are producing into braille is written in a different language, then you need to select a different DBT Template.</p>

        <h3>Multiple Templates for this Language</h3>
        <p>For this language, there are two DBT Templates. One Template says <b>with Nemeth</b>; the other omits these words.</p>
        <p>Nemeth refers to the use of the Nemeth Code (code for mathematics and science). The Template without <b>Nemeth</b> makes use of the UEB (Unified English Braille) for mathematics and science notation.</p>
        <p>For documents not using math symbols, it does not matter what you choose. For documents using math symbols, you have two choices. If you prepare your file using MathType, a program that embeds math equations within Microsoft Word, the preparation of braille mathematics is automatic, no matter which of these two braille codes you have chosen.</p>
        <h3>Uncontracted Braille</h3>
        <p>This language is usually produced in uncontracted braille. This means that words in the text are produced in braille on a one-for-one basis. One braille character for each inkprint symbol. Some inkprint punctuation may require more than one braille character. Showing upper case, emphasis, or numbers will add braille characters to the character count. But there are no abbreviations or contractions. If you have questions about how braille is produced, please contact a member of your local braille authority.</p>
        <h3>Non-Roman Script</h3>
        <p>This language is written in a script other than the Roman alphabet. This may result in problems when importing files into DBT. Your best bet is to import files from Microsoft Word or Open Office that are written in a Unicode font. You can contact support at Duxbury Systems if you have a file which does not import properly into DBT. Please send the file which does not import (the original inkprint file), not a screen shot of DBT.</p>
        <p>Duxbury Systems strives to work with users to make sure that our software works with as many file formats as possible. Contact us if you have any concerns.</p>
