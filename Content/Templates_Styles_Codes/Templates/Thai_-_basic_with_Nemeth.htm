        <p>You are seeing this page since the DBT Template you selected is <b>Thai - basic with Nemeth</b>.</p>
        <p>When you open (import) a file into Duxbury DBT, you have an opportunity to select a DBT Template. If you select a default Template, then you do not have to select a Template each time you open a file. Once you highlight the name of a DBT Template, you can click on the button that says <b>Select Template as Default</b>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>This is a basic DBT Template. <a href="basic.htm">Click here for more information about Basic Templates</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>This DBT Template is designed to produce material written in the <b>Thai</b> language.</p>
        <p>If the text you are producing into braille is written in a different language, then you need to select a different DBT Template.</p>

        <h3>Multiple Templates for this Language</h3>
        <p>For this language, there are two DBT Templates. One Template says <b>with Nemeth</b>; the other omits these words.</p>
        <p>Nemeth refers to the use of the Nemeth Code (code for mathematics and science). The Template without <b>Nemeth</b> makes use of the UEB (Unified English Braille) for mathematics and science notation.</p>
        <p>For documents not using math symbols, it does not matter what you choose. For documents using math symbols, you have two choices. If you prepare your file using MathType, a program that embeds math equations within Microsoft Word, the preparation of braille mathematics is automatic, no matter which of these two braille codes you have chosen.</p>
        <h3>Uncontracted Braille</h3>
        <p>This language is usually produced in uncontracted braille. This means that words in the text are produced in braille on a one-for-one basis. One braille character for each inkprint symbol. Some inkprint punctuation may require more than one braille character. Showing upper case, emphasis, or numbers will add braille characters to the character count. But there are no abbreviations or contractions. If you have questions about how braille is produced, please contact a member of your local braille authority.</p>
        <h3>Non-Roman Script</h3>
        <p>This language is written in a script other than the Roman alphabet. This may result in problems when importing files into DBT. Your best bet is to import files from Microsoft Word or Open Office that are written in a Unicode font. You can contact support at Duxbury Systems if you have a file which does not import properly into DBT. Please send the file which does not import (the original inkprint file), not a screen shot of DBT.</p>
        <p>Duxbury Systems strives to work with users to make sure that our software works with as many file formats as possible. Contact us if you have any concerns.</p>
        <h3>Improving Thai or Lao Braille: Word Endings</h3>
        <p>The Problem of Word or Syllable Endings</p>
        <p>Inkprint files containing Thai (and Lao) text do not usually have spaces between words. In the process of producing braille, the user ends up with the braille characters, but no idea where the word divisions are. The resulting braille output divides the line at the wrong places. Duxbury DBT needs to know where the division points between words are in these two languages.</p>
        <p>In our search for a way to insert word endings into Thai text, we came across software named <a href="http://www.laoscript.net/LaoScript8">LaoScript8</a>. It is basically an add-on for Microsoft Word (or Open Office) to improve functionality for Lao and Thai, distributed by <a href="https://secure.tavultesoft.com/about.php">Tavultisoft</a>, a company located in Tasmania. There are three purchase levels of LaoScript8:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free Edition -- This only gives fonts and keyboard mapping. The free edition does not offer improvement to Thai Word files</li>
            <li>Standard Edition ($20) -- This can be used to add word endings for Lao in Microsoft Office or Open Office.</li>
            <li>Gold Edition ($30) -- This can be used to add word endings for Lao or Thai in Microsoft Office or Open Office.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The feature that helps Thai braille production will be in the next version. Until it is officially released, a copy of the software can be downloaded for those with a Gold Edition copy at <a href="http://laoscript.net/downloads/laoscript8.msi">http://laoscript.net/downloads/laoscript8.msi</a>. The developer, John Durdin, warns there may be undiscovered bugs in this build, but it has worked well for him.</p>
        <p>As you use Microsoft Word (after obtaining, installing and licensing the LaoScript8 software), you find a menu choice LaoScript8 inside of Word.</p>
        <p>Just as you are finished with a document (and are ready to produce braille), click on the LaoScript menu. This produces a ribbon in Word. To use the new function, go to the LaoScript Menu, then click on Settings, then More Settings and set the </p>
        <p>Thai to Thai Word selection option to None (wrap Thai with ZWSP).</p>
        <p>Then, in a Word document, use LaoScript8 - Thai to Thai (Automatic) to insert ZWSP into the Thai text at word and syllable boundaries. While the current menu setting suggests translation into Lao, this does not occur. The result is a Thai file with ZWSP characters.</p>
        <p>To be technical, LaoScript8 inserts Unicode U+200B as its end of word markers. This Unicode character is called a zero length space. Usually, these cause two characters to be printed closer together by adding a zero-length non-printing character which tells the inkprint rendering to potentially divide lines at these positions. Duxbury DBT looks for these U+200B characters and divides braille lines based on where these are placed.</p>
