        <p>You are seeing this page since the DBT Template you selected is <b>Swedish Uncontracted - basic</b>.</p>
        <p>When you open (import) a file into Duxbury DBT, you have an opportunity to select a DBT Template. If you select a default Template, then you do not have to select a Template each time you open a file. Once you highlight the name of a DBT Template, you can click on the button that says <b>Select Template as Default</b>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>This is a basic DBT Template. <a href="basic.htm">Click here for more information about Basic Templates</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>This DBT Template is designed to produce material written in the <b>Swedish</b> language.</p>
        <p>If the text you are producing into braille is written in a different language, then you need to select a different DBT Template.</p>

        <h3>Multiple Templates for Swedish</h3>
        <p>The Swedish language has multiple DBT Templates.</p>
        <p>Here is the list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Swedish Uncontracted - basic no capitals</li>
            <li>Swedish Uncontracted - basic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The current braille translation code calls for <b>Swedish Uncontracted - basic</b>. The "no capitals" choice is available for those who wish to produce braille in the older code.</p>
        <h3>Uncontracted Braille</h3>
        <p>This language is usually produced in uncontracted braille. This means that words in the text are produced in braille on a one-for-one basis. One braille character for each inkprint symbol. Some inkprint punctuation may require more than one braille character. Showing upper case, emphasis, or numbers will add braille characters to the character count. But there are no abbreviations or contractions. If you have questions about how braille is produced, please contact a member of your local braille authority.</p>
