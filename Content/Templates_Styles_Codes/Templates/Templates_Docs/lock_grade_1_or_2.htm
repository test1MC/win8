        <p>
            <MadCap:keyword term="LOCK:Grade 2" />In the previous versions of DBT, if you had set up a Template to default to Grade 1 or Grade 2 braille, it was possible for authors to change grade through the <a href="../../../the_menus/MENU_LAYOUT/Layout_Translation_Codes.htm">Layout: Translation Codes</a> menu, or equivalent keystrokes.</p>
        <p>From 10.6 four new codes have been introduced which can only be used by either inserting the codes into the "initial" Style in a template, or manually inserting the Codes into the actual document. This is intentional, and designed to prevent undesired changes</p>
        <p>The two codes <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1l]</span> and <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2l]</span> (the last character is l as in Lima or lock) will work in the same way as the <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1]</span> and<span class="Code-DuxCode"> [g2]</span> Codes, <u>but cannot be overridden in the usual way</u>.</p>
        <p>If it is essential to switch grades mid-document, you must manually insert either <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g1u]</span> (u as in unlock) or <span class="Code-DuxCode">[g2u]</span> at the appropriate place in the text.</p>
