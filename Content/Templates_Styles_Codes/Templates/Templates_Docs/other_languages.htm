        <h2>Adding a New Language to Duxbury DBT</h2>
        <p>If there is a choice of braille systems used, Duxbury Systems first supports the system that is the agreed way to produce textbooks for elementary, middle, and high school students. </p>
        <p>Occasionally, we are asked to produce a translator for a system used by adults to read the data on computer screens. Duxbury Systems feels that these systems are best left to be supported by access software (such as JAWS, Window-EYES, or NVDA).</p>
        <p>We very much appreciate obtaining the electronic copies of braille code books from around the world. Usually, these are not written in English. That is just the way it should be. We have read about braille in many languages. It is rare that we have difficulty understanding the rules from our source material. Please e-mail any files in whatever form you have (PDF, Word, Open-Office, or text file) to <a href="mailto:languages@duxsys.com">languages@duxsys.com</a></p>
        <p>Duxbury Systems would very much like to make corrections to any translator that needs a correction. We prefer to see the copy of the official rule book, so we know that we are making a correction based on the best possible sources.</p>
        <p>Duxbury Systems can add a new language. Again, we need to work with good source material, and work with a partner who can communicate via e-mail. We prefer to work on languages that have five million speakers. Sometimes we work on languages with only one million speakers.</p>
        <h2>Hidden Language Support</h2>
        <p>These languages are not in the list of DBT Templates. You can still get good results by using a specific DBT Template.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about this, please contact languages@duxsys.com</p>
        <h3>Languages (in Spain) that use the DBT Spanish uncontracted translator</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Basque</li>
            <li>Gallaecian</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other European Languages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Greenlandic uses the DBT Danish Translator</li>
            <li>Faroese uses the DBT Icelandic Translator</li>
            <li>Saami uses the DBT Norwegian (Norse) Translator</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other Languages in Indiaout</h3>
        <p>The translators for the languages of India are designed to handle text in almost all of the languages of India. Choose a "big sister language" in DBT which uses the same script as the language you are working with. DBT should be able to provide quality braille for the language you are working with.</p>
        <p>Example: <b>Konkani</b> is not listed in the menus of DBT. However Hindi, Kannada, and Malayalam do appear on the menus of DBT. Depending on your prefer ed writing system for Konkani, choose one of these three languages from the menus of DBT. However, if you do have Konkani text written in the Roman alphabet, this approach will not work.</p>
        <h3>Languages (in Indonesia) which use the DBT Javanese Translator</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Sunda</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to Produce Karakalpul Braille</h3>
        <p>Karakalpul is a language in Uzbekistan. Use the Uzbek DBT translator. At the top of the inkprint file, insert the DBT code <b>vrn~kaa</b>. To do this type <b>control-[ vrn~kaa &lt;Enter&gt;</b>. This form of DBT code is called a variation code. It adjusts the Uzbek translator for <b>kaa</b> (the three letter ISO code for Karakalpul).</p>
