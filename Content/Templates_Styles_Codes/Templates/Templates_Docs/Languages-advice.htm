        <h1>Languages - ESSENTIAL INFORMATION</h1>
        <p>Before you even consider producing braille in another language please be completely sure you understand the following. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us - <a href="mailto:languages@duxsys.com?subject=Languages - ESSENTIAL INFORMATION">languages@duxsys.com</a>.</p>
        <p>It may come as a surprise to know that while the same <u>printed</u> document, such as a French language newspaper article, may appear visually identical in print regardless of whether produced in France, Chicago, Quebec, or French West&#160;Africa, this is not always the case for braille. WHY?</p>
        <p>Although we shall use "French" as our example in what follows, the problem illustrated could apply to any language.</p>
        <p>There are three main issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is the braille reader a native French speaker, or is the braille reader learning French as a second language?</li>
            <li>What are the customary production rules for your organization or jurisdiction?</li>
            <li>What form of French braille is the braille reader expecting?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are making braille for someone in a French-speaking nation, you would begin your document using one of the <a href="../FRENCH.htm">French</a> Templates, where there are two main options, "Uncontracted" ("integral") or "Contracted" ("abrege") braille, often referred to as "Grade 1" or "Grade 2" braille. For each of these options, there is an additional Template which causes any emphasis such as bold, underline, or italics to be ignored ("de base" in the list of DBT&#160;Templates).</p>
        <p>Hence, if you need to produce French braille in this first case and you do not know which of the four options to use, the answer <u>must</u> come from your client or end user. They are the only ones who can answer the question!</p>
        <p>In the case where French is a secondary language to the reader, many countries have specific guidelines for the use of non-native languages. For example, in the United Kingdom the braille authority (UKAAF) has published guidelines which allow three possible options: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Method 1. Using standard UEB signs throughout.</li>
            <li>Method 2. Using foreign language signs for accented letters.</li>
            <li>Method 3. Using the full foreign language braille code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the same time, one also has to consider whether or not uncontracted (Grade 1) braille should be used for the foreign language content.</p>
        <p>The full document may be obtained here:</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.ukaaf.org/braille/ueb/">http://www.ukaaf.org/braille/ueb/</a> (Select "Foreign Language Guidelines")</p>
        <p>From the above, you will hopefully appreciate the necessity of establishing with your client or end user precisely what is required.</p>
        <p>There are other issues to be aware of related to handling languages. Some languages have complications because they are written right-to-left. Some languages you can clipboard directly into DBT, some languages you cannot. For some languages the print may display poorly in DBT, although the braille comes out fine. For specific advice on a language, please read the information Duxbury provides that is associated with each DBT Template.</p>
        <p>Another issue to watch for is that most DBT Templates include foreign language styles, such as French, German, Italian, Spanish, etc. These styles are designed to be used for excursions from the base language into a passage in a different language. If you are producing a document in French, do not apply the French style to the whole document. Not only will it not help, it will contradict some of the normal settings in a French template.</p>
        <p>We hope you have found this discussion helpful. After you have consulted with your end user, if you wish additional general guidance, we will do our best to assist.</p>
