        <p>You are seeing this page since the DBT Template you selected is <b>German Uncontracted - basic</b>.</p>
        <p>When you open (import) a file into Duxbury DBT, you have an opportunity to select a DBT Template. If you select a default Template, then you do not have to select a Template each time you open a file. Once you highlight the name of a DBT Template, you can click on the button that says <b>Select Template as Default</b>.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>This is a basic DBT Template. <a href="basic.htm">Click here for more information about Basic Templates</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>This DBT Template is designed to produce material written in the <b>German</b> language.</p>
        <p>If the text you are producing into braille is written in a different language, then you need to select a different DBT Template.</p>

        <h3>Multiple Templates for German</h3>
        <p>The German language has multiple DBT Templates.</p>
        <p>Here is the list:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>German - basic </li>
            <li>German Uncontracted - basic</li>
            <li>German Vollschrift - basic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>German braille is usually contracted. For that use <b>German - basic</b>. German Vollschrift is a system of lightly contracted braille that is almost uncontracted. It is used, but rarely. Use uncontracted German if that is what you want.</p>
        <h3>Contracted Braille</h3>
        <p>This language is usually produced in <b>contracted</b> braille. This means that words are not produced in braille on a one-for-one basis. There are abbreviations or contractions in the text. If you have questions about how braille is produced, please contact a member of your local braille authority.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, you may want to produce uncontracted braille. This is easy to do with DBT. Before translation into braille, go to the top of the document in DBT, and issue the command <b>Alt-1</b>. When you translate into braille, the braille will be uncontracted</p>
