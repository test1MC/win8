        <p><u>The Delete Style dialog box is used to remove an existing style from the list of those available within the current document.</u> There is only one control: a list of existing styles.</p>
        <p>Be careful not to remove any styles that have been applied in the current document; the formatting effects would be lost as a result.</p>
