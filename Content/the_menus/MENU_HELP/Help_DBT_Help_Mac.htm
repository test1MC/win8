        <h3><a name="top"></a>Help: DBT Help</h3>
        <p class="Keystroke">Keystroke: None; select from menu.</p>
        <p>Selecting this menu item opens DBT Help, starting at the first level of a multi-level table of contents, which allows you to navigate to your area of interest, and then "drill down" from there.</p>
        <p>The help system is extensive, and based on years of experience with DBT on the Microsoft Windows platform. If you find a topic that still holds Windows-centric information, kindly be patient as we bring all our DBT for Mac documentation up to date.</p>
        <p>The Help window remains in the foreground as long as it is open. To close Help, click on the standard window close button in the top left corner.</p>
