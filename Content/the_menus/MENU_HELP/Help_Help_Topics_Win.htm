        <h3>Help: Help Topics...</h3>
        <p class="Keystroke">Keystroke: <span class="Keyboard">h</span> (from menu)</p>
        <p>This menu pick opens up the DBT&#160;On-line Help system, which displays a multi-level table of contents to assist you in finding the information you seek.</p>
        <p>In addition to opening up Help this way, which starts at the top page of the Help topics, you will find that many topics can be accessed directly from DBT's menus and dialogs by pressing the <span class="Keyboard">F1</span> key. For example, if you were in the dialog for creating a new document, a tap of the <span class="Keyboard">F1</span> key would display the help topic "File:New...".</p>
        <p>To close Help, hold down the Alt key and tap the <span class="Keyboard">F4</span> key, and you will be returned to your previous position.</p>
