        <p class="Keystroke" MadCap:conditions="Primary.Windows_Version">Keystroke: <span class="Keyboard">L</span> from Character Codes menu</p>

        <p>This is a special braille character normally used in Grade 2 to indicate that what follows is an isolated letter, as opposed to a word.</p>
        <p>For example, in English Braille, the letter k means "knowledge". If the letter k was proceeded by dots 5,6 the reader would know that this means simply the letter k.</p>
        <p>To use this command, place your cursor immediately in front of the letter for which you wish a letter sign to precede, and select Letter Sign from the Character Codes Menu. An <span class="Code-DuxScreen">&amp;+</span> will appear in the print version as show below. In braille the appropriate letter sign will be shown.</p>
        <p class="CourierPara"><span class="Code-DuxScreen" style="font-family: monospace;">"He did not have any knowledge of &amp;+k, which in computer terms means kilobytes."</span>
