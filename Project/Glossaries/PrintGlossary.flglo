      <Term>Hard Space</Term>
    </Terms>
    <Definition
      Link="">The braille translator normally automatically removes more than one space between words. A hard space "forces" space where you intentionally want additional spaces to appear in Braille. DBT won't break lines at hard spaces the way it might at ordinary spaces. An example of this is where, for ease of reading, you do not want a 
 telephone number to be split over 2 lines. To insert a Hard Space, place your cursor 
 where you want to have a Hard Space, and press Alt+F2</Definition>

drilling or whatever method is used to hold the pages together. The binding margin is measured in characters or braille cells on an embosser, or in inches or millimeters on a printer. For single-sided work, the binding margin is the same thing as the left margin. For interpoint braille output, the binding margin is also the right margin on the back side of each sheet.</Definition>
